      "Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8\".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c\n",
      "I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!\n",
      "This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!\n",
      "I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.\n",
      "I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.\n",
      "I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...\n",
      "I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.\n",
      "I'm 5\"5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.\n",
      "Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.\n",
      "This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.\n",
      "More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid\n",
      "Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).\r\n",
      "my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.\r\n",
      "the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.\r\n",
      "i'm 5'6\" and it came to just below my knees.\n",
      "This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip\n",
      "I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!\n",
      "Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.\n",
      "Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.\n",
      "A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.\n",
      "I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.\n",
      "If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. \r\n",

      "fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting.\n",
      "I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb\n",
      "First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!\n",
      "Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.\n",
      "I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!\n",
      "Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5\" and there was atleast 5\" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans\n",
      "I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh\n",
      "The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end.\n",
      "I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....\n",
      "This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.\n",
      "Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!\n",
      "I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer\n",
      "These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.\n",
      "I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.\n",
      "This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!\n",
      "Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!\n",
      "This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.\n",
      "Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6\", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3\", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.\n",
      "Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.\n",
      "Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.\n",
      "Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors, print, and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!\n",
      "This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.\n",
      "This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!\n",
      "First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3\" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot\n",
      "Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8\"\" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!\n",
      "I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.\n",
      "I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.\n",
      "Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering\n",
      "This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.\n",
      "Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.\n",
      "This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.\n",
      "I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7\", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.\n",
      "Love the color and style, but material snags easily\n",
      "Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun\n",
      "Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.\n",
      "This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.\n",
      "I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!\n",
      "This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.\n",
      "I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th\n",
      "I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)\n",
      "This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.\n",
      "3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!\n",
      "I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.\n",
      "Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!\n",
      "Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!\n",
      "Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate\n",
      "Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me\n",
      "Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!\n",
      "I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...\n",
      "I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.\n",
      "This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42\" and sweep is over 70\". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.\n",
      "Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s\n",
      "I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. \r\n",

      "I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful.\n",
      "I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear\n",
      "I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2\", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs\n",
      "I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit.\n",

      "I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.\n",
      "This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(\n",

      "I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!\n",
      "This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.\n",

      "I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.\n",
      "At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso.\n",
      "I find that this brand can be a little bit all-over-the-place with sizes. had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m. despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well. i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this. just something to keep in mind. still a great shirt, love the neutral color.\n",

      "I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.\n",
      "Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.\n",
      "I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.\n",
      "The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.\n",

      "I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4\" (~118#). i guess i just didn't \"love\" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca\n",
      "I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5\"2\", broad shoulders, 120 lb)\n",

      "The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.\n",

      "This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1\" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.\n",
      "First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.\n",
      "The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.\r\n",

      "This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.\n",
      "After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4\"/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!\n",

      "Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.\n",

      "This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather.\n",

      "Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort\n",
      "It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3\" 140# 39-28-35 an\n",

      "I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.\n",
      "This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy\n",

      "Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.\n",

      "The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.\n",

      "This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .\n",
      "Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.\n",
      "The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.\n",

      "The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.\n",
      "I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!\n",

      "the fabric is beautiful, and i loved the way they draped. the angled cut on the legs is very cute, and something a bit different. these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner, because the fabric is very light and breezy. dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and you're good to go.\n",
      "Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater, if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5'7, 34c, and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer!\n",
      "This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.\n",
      "Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.\n",
      "Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3\"). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy.\n",
      "I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn't look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable.\n",
      "The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned\n",
      "Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is\n",

      "colors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)\n",
      "I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7\" size 10-12 and the large fit just right.\n",
      "Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist.\n",
      "Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.\n",
      "I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu\n",

      "This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.\n",
      "Just came today: the print is gorgeous.  very bohemian. it's a dressier dress with the chiffon.  on the con side, the chiffon is very delicate, snagged easily while trying on. there's raw edges on the waistband, needed trimming fresh out of the package.  sz 10 fit in the waist, too small for 36d bust; sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist.  sz 10 ankle length for 5'7\", 12 hits the floor.  haven't decided if i'll keep the 12 and try to alter.\n",
      "My waist measures 28\" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good.\n",
      "I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.)\n",
      "I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.\n",

      "Finally a \"swing top\" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks \"dumpy\" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7\" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a \"swing\" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!\n",
      "I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces). \r\n",

      "Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.\n",
      "Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.\n",
      "I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10\". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t\n",
      "I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.\n",
      "Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "great, versatile shirt.\n",
      "I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers, it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well.\n",
      "Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might\n",
      "Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.\n",

      "Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11\"!).\n",
      "I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love, the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine\n",

      "I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!\n",
      "Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.\n",
      "Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down!\n",
      "I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w\n",
      "This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely.\n",
      "Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.\n",
      "From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.\n",
      "I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!\n",
      "This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl\n",
      "This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!\n",
      "I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!\n",
      "Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes!\n",
      "I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesn't seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first.\n",
      "Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous\n",
      "I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.\n",
      "Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.\n",
      "I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...\n",
      "\n",
      "i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on\n",
      "Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.\r\n",

      "a must have for the summer!!!!!!\n",
      "Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7\", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the \"2\" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!\n",
      "I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable\n",
      "Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace.\n",
      "Love this top!\n",
      "it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.\n",
      "i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.\n",
      "love both colors, and having fun wearing them.\n",
      "and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.\n",
      "runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.\n",
      "if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size\n",
      "The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.\n",
      "Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.\n",
      "I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7\" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!\n",
      "This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!\n",
      "I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.\n",
      "I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.\r\n",
      "looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.\n",
      "After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!\n",
      "Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!\n",
      "I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.\n",
      "I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.\n",
      "Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!\n",
      "The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.\n",
      "Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.\n",
      "I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.\n",
      "I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal\n",
      "I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo\n",
      "Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9\" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles.\n",
      "I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.\n",
      "I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm 5'4\" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel\n",
      "This dress is stunning- vibrant colors and flirty feel to it. i got the small and i am a 34b/27 pants, 132 lbs- great fit. i only question two things- am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra? those two considerations are why i didn't give it 5 stars.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was\n",
      "I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite\n",
      "I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!\r\n",
      "it is an absolute must-have!\n",
      "I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.\n",
      "I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!\n",
      "This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down\n",
      "I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a\n",
      "First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.\n",
      "I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped \"sweater\" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier.\n",
      "This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.\n",
      "Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress\n",
      "True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!\n",
      "I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!\n",
      "I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5\" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.\n",
      "Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3\"). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)\n",
      "I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6\" short torso and my usual 6 worked.\n",
      "I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri\n",
      "Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.\n",
      "This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.\n",
      "I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers.\n",
      "This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.\n",
      "This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b\n",
      "\n",
      "The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5\"there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.\n",
      "Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2\" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!\n",
      "I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3\" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p\n",

      "I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!\n",
      "The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.\n",
      "I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short\n",
      "This dress has potential, but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9\"). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit,\n",
      "I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.\n",
      "I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.\n",
      "This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.\n",
      "My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.\n",
      "This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality\n",
      "I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need\n",
      "When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.\n",
      "Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.\n",
      "Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.\n",
      "This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.\n",
      "Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.\n",
      "I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!\n",
      "I am 5.6\", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous\n",
      "This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.\n",
      "This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4\", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.\n",
      "Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8\", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!\n",
      "I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.\n",
      "Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.\n",
      "I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.\n",
      "Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style.\n",
      "The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.\n",

      "Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.\n",
      "This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.\n",
      "I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.\n",
      "I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i\n",
      "I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.\n",
      "This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn't make it work\r\n",

      "Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8\" and athletic.\n",

      "I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2\", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the\n",
      "Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not\n",

      "Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.\n",

      "This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.\n",
      "I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.\n",
      "I love this top, it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!\n",
      "This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a\n",

      "I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a \"true to size\" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!\n",
      "I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.\n",
      "Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and\n",
      "I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7\", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.\n",
      "If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.\n",
      "Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress. \r\n",

      "I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.\n",

      "Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!\n",
      "Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely \"vanity-sized\". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you\n",

      "Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.\n",

      "I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8\" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly.\n",
      "I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!\n",
      "Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.\n",
      "Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.\n",
      "Very nice casual, inexpensive shirt and the laced neckline is great....not too revealing and easily worn tied \r\n",
      "without looking prudish. and of course, open as well\n",
      "When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!\n",
      "I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say, i won't be keeping the dress. the layers, fabric, and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.\n",
      "I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.\n",
      "I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.\n",
      "This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!\n",
      "Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun, distinctive new shift dress. got it, tried it on, took it off, went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image, but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10\" right in the middl\n",
      "This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.\n",
      "I love this shirt so much that i've now bought it in 2 colors -- the olive green and the red. probably would have bought it in black too if i didn't already have enough black shirts. it's both a plain and simple tee, but with the fun lace-up detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boring.\n",

      "it runs true to size but is very fitted. however, due to the thickness of the material, i didn't feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted, despite how close the shirt fit to my\n",
      "Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.\n",
      "I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice.\n",
      "I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4\", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend.\n",
      "I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.\n",
      "Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a \"fat stage\"...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good.\n",
      "This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!\n",
      "I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5\" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction.\n",
      "It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did\n",
      "Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.\n",
      "This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!\n",
      "I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a \"versatile\" v and\n",
      "A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.\n",
      "This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.\r\n",
      "it looks and feels like really good quality.\n",
      "This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!\n",
      "When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.\n",
      "I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.\n",
      "I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.\n",
      "This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.\n",
      "I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9\" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is\n",
      "I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8\", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th\n",
      "Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening\n",
      "I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3\" about 124 lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth\n",
      "Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. \r\n",
      "however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned.\n",
      "I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend \"cold shoulder\" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo\n",
      "Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.\n",
      "I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...\n",
      "I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!\n",
      "I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.\n",
      "I agree that this blouse is boxy, but because it's not too long in length it evens it out. any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy. it's great for work to dinner during the week & goes great with jeans too.\n",
      "Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won't work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes!\n",
      "I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal\n",
      "I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!\n",
      "Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints\n",
      "This top reminds me of the special tops i got \"once upon a time\"...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement.\n",
      "This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!\n",
      "I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2\" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6\" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4\" and size small hem fell about 1\" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like \"faux leather\" since they\n",
      "...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down\n",
      "This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.\n",
      "Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.\n",
      "Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.\n",
      "The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.\n",
      "I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d\n",
      "This is a pretty top that is conservative enough for the office, with a modest neckline. there is a little hidden snap or button under the bow at the neck so you don't have to keep fussing with the tie the fit is loose in the waist and high at the neck, so the sheer parts are the only thing to give it a little flirtiness. there is a matching camisole underneath that snaps in at the shoulders. overall, i thought it was nice when i tried it at the store, but it didn't have enough extra \"wow\" to ge\n",
      "Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.\n",
      "Is not a place i want to be, even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes, this sweater is very cropped, but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.\n",
      "The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou\n",
      "Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.\n",
      "This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa\n",
      "Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!\n",
      "This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.\n",
      "Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.\n",
      "This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!\n",
      "I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9\", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4\" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.\r\n",
      "also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.\r\n",
      "too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.\n",
      "Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3\" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric.\n",
      "I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.\n",
      "This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.\n",
      "A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!\n",
      "This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.\n",
      "Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe\n",

      "Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.\n",

      "Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.\n",
      "This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.\n",
      "I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy, so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all, its a fun dress!\n",
      "This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!\n",
      "This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5\" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.\n",

      "I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin\n",
      "This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often!\n",
      "looks good with navy tights too!\n",
      "Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s\n",
      "I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.\n",
      "This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.\n",
      "I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!\n",
      "This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3\", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg\n",
      "Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh well, it's going back!\n",
      "This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.\n",
      "I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2\" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.\n",
      "I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7\" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s\n",
      "The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !\n",
      "So pretty, but does run large. i am an 8-10 , got the 8 and big through the chest. had to return for this reason. if you are on the busty side it will look fab on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2\" but 36d and have 31\" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the\n",
      "Love the detail and the way it hangs. i sometimes struggle with blousy tops because i have a larger chest, but this one didn't make me look pregnant! i purchased this with the 30% off... i wouldn't have paid full price for it.\n",
      "I really wanted this to work. for me the arm cutout was too wide. a cap or lace flutter sleeve would've worked . also expected a little more length felt like the petite length.\n",
      "I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.\n",
      "Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back.\n",
      "I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th\n",
      "I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4\" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all.\n",
      "it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me.\n",
      "the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me.\n",
      "i was able to close the zipper by myself.\n",
      "i'm 5'7\" 144lb 36a.\n",
      "the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all.\n",
      "the only down side is that it looks more expens\n",
      "This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l\n",
      "This top runs super small in the upper arms, shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem, the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10, 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...\n",
      "A nice alternative to jeans, good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.\n",
      "I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.\n",
      "This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy.\n",
      "This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...\n",
      "Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that's stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it's more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.\n",
      "I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9\" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really \"makes\" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit\n",
      "This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.\n",
      "The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.\n",
      "Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso, and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that, the material is a very good qu\n",
      "I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.\n",
      "Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.\n",
      "Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).\n",
      "I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable\n",
      "Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li\n",
      "I am 5'3\" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9\") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your\n",
      "Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.\n",
      "This is a beautiful top. it extended longer than i had hoped and a petite size was not available, so i ended up returning it. but it is beautiful and the tassels on the sides make it truly unique.\n",
      "Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those \"special\" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.\r\n",
      "the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r\n",
      "This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning, the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect.\n",
      "Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.\n",
      "Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.\n",
      "This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!\n",
      "I am 5'2\" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.\n",
      "Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!\n",
      "Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.\n",
      "My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online, so that was nice to see consistency. overall though, i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks, which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short, and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving, walking or dancing in this dress, which brings me to the question of\n",
      "I saw this online and thought, hmm, no. then saw it in the store, touched it, and the fabric felt so soft. i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier, but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store. the 4 just looked promising. i thought i'd try it on for laughs. but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home. the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom, 5'2, 145 lb figure. my measurements are 34(b)-29-38, and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular! perfect length a\n",
      "Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.\n",
      "This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.\n",
      "I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3\" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has\n",
      "These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.\n",
      "I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!\n",
      "I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5\" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect.\n",
      "First, my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice, but stiff, so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting, but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me, not up to the usual ms standard.\n",
      "This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1\", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28\" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25\" long, but it's actually just about 24\". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)\n",
      "These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!\n",
      "I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than\n",
      "It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.\n",
      "I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.\n",
      "I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4\", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.\n",
      "This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!\n",
      "Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0\", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)\n",
      "This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.\n",
      "The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.\n",
      "Ordered the navy and aqua in medium. the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy. loved the color on both but returning the the aqua. normally wear size 6\n",
      "Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10\" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks.\n",
      "When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.\n",
      "I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.\n",
      "Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!\n",
      "This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.\n",
      "The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.\n",
      "I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3\" 120 lbs and ordered the small.\n",
      "This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress, the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags, etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.\n",
      "These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!\n",
      "I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!\n",
      "This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.\n",
      "Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2\", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.\n",
      "This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!\n",
      "Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted.\n",
      "Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf, not cute-short, just off. (i'm 5'8\" and 125#) to quote my husband, \"nope. not feeling these.\" that said, they feel great on, seem to be made well, but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)\n",
      "I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.\n",
      "I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2\", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.\n",
      "Cute comfortable top. fits well and will look great with skinny jeans.\n",
      "I got the shorts and the blue motif they're really comfortable and will look cute with a tank top for the weekend.   they true to size them usually a size 4 to 6 and i got a small and that works.\n",
      "I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!\n",
      "Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!\n",
      "This is a great pant to wear to business and when you just need something more than a jean. not so skinny a 50+ woman can wear comfortably..\n",
      "These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my \"go to\" black pants for the fall season!\n",
      "I got this to wear as a beach cover-up over bathing suits. if you purchased a darker color and were small chested (i.e., you could go braless, since a bra won't work well with the low back and armholes), you might be able to pull this off as a very casual dress. i bought this in a xs in the coral/peach (i'm 5'7\", 129 lbs., 32dd) and it's not super see-through, but i'd never be comfortable wearing it as a dress on its own. as a beach cover-up it's cute and comfortable, but as a dress it would be\n",
      "I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.\n",
      "This is a great casual summer dress. cute as a cover up but in the black you can definitely wear it for daytime. if you're feeling bare throw on a white button down or chambray.\n",
      "I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.\r\n",
      "problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).\r\n",
      "problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other\n",
      "This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette, so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand, and\n",
      "This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.\n",
      "I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.\n",
      "These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!\n",
      "This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d\n",
      "I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.\n",
      "Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.\n",
      "I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6\",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go\n",
      "I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!\n",
      "I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th\n",
      "So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti\n",
      "Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .\n",
      "This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!\n",
      "I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th\n",
      "I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!\n",
      "I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3\" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.\n",
      "Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.\n",
      "I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.\n",
      "Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the\n",
      "quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs\n",
      "This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.\n",
      "Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support.\n",
      "This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.\n",
      "I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!\n",
      "These are really cute. nice fabric. i love the rise...not to low, not too high. but they are going back. i'm a size 4. i got these in a 4. they fit fine in the waist and bum but they are tight around my calves. also, they were more like \"high waters\" on me than cropped so a petite in the length probably would have worked better for me had these fit.\n",
      "This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!\n",
      "Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a \"i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice\" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up.\n",
      "These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).\n",
      "I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o\n",
      "The material and construction of the pants are great, but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4\" and the regular came to just above my ankles, and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine, or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants, but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4\", 125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.\n",
      "I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.\n",
      "This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!\n",
      "I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.\n",
      "Unique design. love the collar and broad cuffs. the xs regular fits me better than the s petite, which is a bit short.\n",
      "I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i'm usually xs or small, and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can't compare, but the small was flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'5\" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple, neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it, so it's probably not great for hot da\n",
      "This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10\" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying.\n",
      "Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. \r\n",
      "this is a great top for the weekends!\n",
      "These are the perfect leggings. they're so soft, and they don't stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them. i ordered the grey and moss, and they have different textures, which is fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.\n",
      "I never buy anything at retailer full price, but had to get this when i tried it at my local store, especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering, and super comfortable. fully lined, not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out, or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics, i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low, but on me that is not the case. the t\n",
      "This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.\n",
      "I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!\n",
      "Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.\n",
      "I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small\n",
      "These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!\n",
      "After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,\n",
      "Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i\n",

      "I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts.\n",
      "Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.\n",
      "I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.\n",
      "I think the model is wearing a larger size, per the first review. i am 5'2\" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap, since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it.\n",
      "I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.\n",
      "I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8\"). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!\n",
      "The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top, lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for, and while i'm only around a b\n",
      "This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.\n",
      "The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.\n",

      "Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a\n",
      "It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a \"lightweight sweater.\" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks\n",
      "These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.\n",
      "I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. wasn't sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.\n",
      "I normally wear a size 2 so i ordered a small and an small petite, i will be keeping the small because the small petite looks like a shirt on me, my height is 5'4\". it runs very big underneath the arms as well. the design is so unique i will be keeping it.\n",
      "This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large, and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is \"roomy,\" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous, but a thin camisol\n",
      "So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)\n",
      "I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5\" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it.\n",
      "The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier.\n",
      "I received this sweater in last week, when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy , it is not , the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value.\n",
      "I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i\n",
      "I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)\n",
      "This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.\n",
      "This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though\n",
      "I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!\n",
      "This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9\" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!\n",
      "I love this dress. i'm 5'8\" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.\n",
      "I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.\n",
      "This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style, but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up, so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.\n",
      "This is a very pretty dress and looks just as it's pictured.  however, there is a lot of fabric - the lower half is very full and runs very large.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.\n",
      "I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love. it's a great summer / fall dress. i love the sweater top and linen bottom. so many compliments on it!\n",

      "I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even\n",
      "I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured. i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric. super cute with a grey top, white skinnys and brown leather sandals. love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.\n",
      "This dress is everything. i'm 5'4, athletic build, 36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!\n",
      "I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.\n",
      "I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st\n",
      "Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.\n",
      "Ordered the xsp (5'4\" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks..\n",
      "Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.\n",
      "Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.\n",
      "I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5\" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with\n",
      "This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.\n",
      "The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead, there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting, though, and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section, just the mid section, then tapers in at\n",
      "This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.\n",
      "I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere\n",
      "Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!\n",
      "This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!\n",

      "I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10\" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10\" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.\n",
      "I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.\n",

      "I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!\n",
      "Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium, but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online.\n",

      "I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10\" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. \r\n",

      "I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.\n",
      "Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.\n",
      "This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back.\n",

      "I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!\n",
      "I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.\n",
      "After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try, but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8, smaller on top, and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also, the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.\n",
      "I loved this in the store, but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.\n",
      "I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall\n",
      "Haha, the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline, i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which, with my full bust underneath it, refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.\n",
      "Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5\"130lbs  and 32dd.\n",
      "Has quickly become one of my 'go to' tops. comfortable, cute, looks just like the picture.\n",
      "It is the perfect top to wear in the summer, it is nice and you can be somewhat dressy or super casual. i don't like anything too tight around my stomach and this has a nice flow with just the right amount of material.\n",
      "This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also, the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath, it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you, buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.\n",
      "I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore\n",
      "I ordered size large and find it too boxy and long. love the hem, although the top is too long in this size so it's a bit hard to judge how it'll look in the right size. the sleeves are cute and different, a bit wide and flowing. be warned, it's sheer which is more apparent from the side view. i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem. has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size.\n",
      "This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2\" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.\n",
      "I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. \r\n",

      "I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium.\n",
      "This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. \r\n",
      "this dress is a keeper!\n",
      "Very attractive and easy to wear. i wore it the night it arrived and wore it again the next night! i love the colors, the pattern and design. this is a stylish tunic sweater. the sleeves are not full length, which i prefer. the sweater is dense - the weave is tight, making the sweater quite warm, but not too warm.\n",
      "Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.\n",
      "Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3\" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami. \r\n",
      "my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin\n",
      "Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3\" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer.\n",
      "As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to love this. however, the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.\n",
      "Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.\n",
      "I bought this in black. it's a great long length. i have long arms so the sleeve length is great. it's really soft. only issue is seems to sag a little in the middle instead of being flowy. overall a good tunic.\n",
      "I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!\n",
      "Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.\n",

      "This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.\n",
      "Again, bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink, and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess, mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home, and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child, this one's going back!\n",
      "I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.\n",
      "I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.\n",
      "Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size, the fabric has very little give but is comfortable.\n",
      "This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.\n",
      "Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.\n",
      "After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!\n",
      "I tried this tunic on in my local retailer store. they do not carry petites, so i tried on a regular small (i'm 5'2\", 130lb). the proportions were a bit off. the v-neck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice. i definitely think a petite would work better for my height. alas, no petites in-store or online in the color(s) i would purchase. i didn't find the shirt too thin, as some have commented. it's essentially a midweight t-shirt material (but rayon, so beware o\n",

      "I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range.\n",
      "I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.\n",
      "After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.\n",
      "I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.\n",
      "I ordered the green, black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition.\n",
      "I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.\n",
      "I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.\n",
      "This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1\" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.\n",
      "I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4\", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too\n",
      "This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.\n",

      "hanging at store or the way it was sewn.\n",
      "I ordered this in two colors, in my regular size. i washed and laid flat to dry....it shrunk like crazy. i held the one i washed up to the other unworn/unwashed one and it was at least two inches shorter. they may both be going back. i am so sad.\n",
      "I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!\n",
      "It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly\n",
      "I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.\n",
      "This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.\n",
      "You guys, i love this so much! however, within one hour of wearing it, the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!\n",
      "I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!\n",
      "Love this shirt with leggings. if you are in between sizes- size down\n",
      "Unusual color. expensive even on sale.\n",
      "I am 5'4\" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron\n",
      "Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.\n",
      "I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.\n",
      "The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.\n",
      "I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!\n",
      "I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.\n",
      "Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too \"baggy\" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!\n",
      "I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4\", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha\n",
      "Love this dress! it is super-flattering, and the embroidery is beautiful.\n",
      "I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.\n",
      "Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!\n",
      "Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "please bring this style back!\n",
      "Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...\n",
      "Great style!\n",
      "This top is great - lightweight and flattering.\r\n",
      "i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. \r\n",
      "i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.\n",
      "Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6\" and the size 6 is perfect for me.\n",
      "The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.\n",
      "Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.\n",
      "Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3\" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7\" the model is 5'10\", so yeah 3\" shorter would be cute!\n",
      "Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.\n",
      "I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.\n",
      "This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.\n",
      "This is silly, but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that \"said,\" i am going more casual, and i love the \"flex\" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper, but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?\n",
      "I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11\", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.\n",
      "I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and \"slips\" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s\n",
      "I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.\n",
      "These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.\n",
      "Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.\n",
      "I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.\n",
      "This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher, not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.\n",
      "I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.\n",
      "I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l\n",
      "This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.\n",
      "I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!\n",
      "Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans\n",
      "I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from\n",
      "These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color.\n",
      "Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!\n",
      "Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.\n",
      "Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length\n",
      "i am typically a 10-12\n",
      "but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already\n",
      "more petite, less curvy girls enjoy!\n",
      "its going back,sorry!\n",
      "Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',\n",
      "These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!\n",
      "These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.\n",
      "I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.\n",
      "Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8\" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.\n",
      "I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman, i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!\n",
      "I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m\n",
      "This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.\n",
      "I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.\n",
      "I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again, i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).\r\n",
      "colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh\n",
      "I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!\n",
      "When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!\n",
      "I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.\n",
      "This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the \"flutter\" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!\n",
      "I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not \"red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.\n",
      "These lightweight, wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute, but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide, adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it\n",
      "This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.\n",
      "Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.\n",
      "I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.\r\n",
      "this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.\r\n",
      "the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).\n",
      "This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.\n",
      "I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink, burgundy, gray, white, black, and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!\n",
      "This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!\n",
      "These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.\n",
      "This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer\n",
      "These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.\n",
      "Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.\n",
      "I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.\n",
      "This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the \"red\" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed\n",
      "I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!\n",
      "These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.\n",
      "I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.\r\n",
      "so glad i made this purchase.\n",
      "The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute\n",
      "Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.\n",
      "I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas\n",
      "Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.\n",
      "Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.\n",
      "I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!\n",
      "Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!\n",
      "I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person\r\n",
      "if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.\n",
      "The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!\n",
      "An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.\n",
      "I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically, wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray, i thought, they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash, the weight of the fabric? not sure, but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly, i will be sending them back.\n",
      "I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more!  fabulous quality, material and style.  can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts.  wear alone or layer.  don't miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!\n",
      "I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h\n",
      "Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend\n",
      "I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.\n",
      "Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9\"\n",

      "I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7, 115 lbs, wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish, but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately, when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester, and while it's machine washable (yay), i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily, and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price, so i returned it.\n",
      "This coat is gorgeous but it runs huge! i am typically a s so that is the size i purchased and it was swimming on me. i sadly had to return for an xs so fingers crossed it fits. the coral color is gorgeous and looks nice with my olive skin. very unique coat and as long as the xs fits i will be one happy lady.\n",
      "Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!\n",
      "I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10\". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part.\n",
      "I'm in love, i'm in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3\" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl\n",
      "The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.\n",
      "I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isn't for me. the texture is too soft.\n",
      "Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.\n",
      "I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.\n",
      "This top is stunning. the colors are vivid and it is extremely cozy and soft. however it seems delicate and would need to only be worn once in a while. it is not an everyday top. the material has a cotton candy like appearance. it really is unique and one of a kind.\n",
      "I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.\n",
      "After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what\n",
      "Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed, even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter.\n",
      "Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper.\n",
      "These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.\n",
      "Luv these jeans! they felt so comfy the first time i put them on. it's like butter! i'm a 26 but went down a size and wear a belt. they said they r high rise but i can't see how - but no complaints as i can breathe in them :)\n",
      "Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.\n",
      "This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go. it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides.\n",
      "5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also\n",
      "First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4\" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes\n",
      "The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5\", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).\n",
      "Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love, love this coat\n",
      "I guess this is a true to size, i am usually a 30dd and ordered 32d, fits great. the back is really pretty, so even though it is a tiny bit looser, i decided to keep it...\n",
      "I tried these on as a return at my store and sadly, they fit great everywhere ecept at the waist. i had almost 2 inches gaping at the waist... my usual size. the rest of the pant was absolutely awesome though. for reference, i tried n a 25 and am 115 lbs and short... bummer htey don't come in petite or 24...\n",
      "Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5\" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it.\n",
      "I love the feel and design of this pullover. it is extremely soft and comfy to wear. however, i did find that it runs slightly large, is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy. probably not the best for a petite frame. i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides.\n",
      "I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a\n",
      "I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.\n",
      "This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to\n",
      "I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -\n",
      "I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.\n",
      "It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.\n",
      "Omg - wish it came in more colors,,\n",
      "This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky\n",
      "Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.\n",
      "I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!\n",
      "\n",
      "What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5\"/130lbs and went with the xsp.\n",
      "I was initially attracted to the colors\n",
      "This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up.\n",
      "I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4\" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!\n",
      "This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!\n",
      "The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.\n",
      "I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.\n",
      "Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what \"eira\" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.\n",
      "I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming\n",
      "This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th\n",
      "Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!\n",
      "So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.\n",
      "I really like these jeans, but order a size down. i'm typically a 14 and these were just too big. they stretch as it is and although they should have a baggier fit, they are just too baggie.\n",
      "This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!\n",
      "I ordered this coat in the \"pink\" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)\n",
      "\n",
      "one concern: since the wool is light\n",
      "Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination.\n",

      "Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!\n",
      "I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax, shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.\n",
      "This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.\n",
      "I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2\" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm \"curvy\" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me.\n",
      "Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!\n",
      "Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel\n",
      "I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...\"classic,\" \"fancy,\" \"jackie o.\" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e\n",
      "Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.\n",

      "Warn and super soft. love it !\n",
      "Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.\n",
      "Nice jeans, but had to return. too tight in hips/thighs and big in waist.\n",
      "Im 5'1\" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable, roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather.\n",
      "I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.\n",
      "These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.\n",

      "Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2\" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it's a classic! you will smile!\n",
      "I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i\n",
      "This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.\n",
      "I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5\" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.\n",
      "Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.\n",

      "I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy, oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu\n",

      "Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your \"normal\" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love\n",
      "Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!\n",
      "I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful\n",
      "This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.\n",
      "The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!\n",
      "At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.\n",
      "I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it's supposed to be a little oversized looking), great color (i have the ivory and it's beautiful), and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos, but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings, skirts or just jeans.\n",
      "I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5\" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.\n",
      "Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.\n",
      "I am 5'6\", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-2 p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.\r\n",
      "also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party.\n",

      "I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,\n",
      "Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.\n",
      "This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5\" frame but because of the detailing...it just works.\n",
      "Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.\n",
      "Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.\n",
      "Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.\n",
      "I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.\n",
      "I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2\" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!\n",
      "Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall\n",
      "I got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous.  i'm not so much into wearing a farm animal image, but the colors are just too striking to pass this up. the sweater is tts, but with a slightly baggy fit. i did not find it scratchy.\n",
      "Really cute and very comfortable. material is thin and sheer. i wear tanks under things anyway, but especially in pink, you would need to. but love the style.\n",
      "I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1\" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!\n",
      "I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!\n",
      "This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.\n",
      "I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,\n",
      "Bought this is the blue, which is actually a very grey-blue.  i love cotton sweaters and they are not easy to find.  this one has lovely colors and unusual design, but is a bit too full.  that said, i am keeping it for the cotton/linen factor, alone.\n",
      "My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104\" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6\" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.\n",
      "I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.\n",
      "I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8\", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this\n",
      "I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.\n",
      "I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!\n",
      "This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested.\n",
      "I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!\n",
      "This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot.\n",
      "I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere\n",
      "Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, \"get it off\" in the fitting room. bummer.\n",
      "True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue \"jeans\"; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.\n",
      "This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d\n",
      "Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.\n",
      "Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!\n",
      "Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!\n",
      "I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!\n",
      "Runs a little big. fabric is very soft and comfortable\n",
      "This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.\n",
      "I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something\n",
      "Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.\n",
      "I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as \"orange\", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.\n",
      "This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! \r\n",
      "i'm 5'2\", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. \r\n",

      "I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,\n",
      "As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.\n",

      "This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.\n",
      "I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts\n",
      "This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.\n",
      "I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.\n",
      "This is a very comfortable, good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short, and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on, it's great.  it is not made in the usa, as stated. it is clearly marked \"made in mexico\" from \"globally sourced\" materials (i.e. not from the us).\n",

      "I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.\n",
      "Pretty pink top is great for layering iand alone in the summer and spring\n",
      "This shirt fits very true to size, with very soft and comfortable material that hangs just right. wears well and is versatile for many occasions. please come out with more colors so i can purchase them as well!\n",
      "I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to\n",
      "I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9\" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi\n",
      "I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...\n",
      "A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!\r\n",
      "it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through\n",
      "I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.\n",
      "Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.\n",

      "After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the\n",

      "Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.\n",
      "I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.\n",
      "This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.\n",

      "Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.\n",
      "I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.\n",
      "Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact,\n",
      "There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced.\n",

      "Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.\n",
      "Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color.\n",
      "The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.\n",

      "I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!\n",
      "This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.\n",
      "I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or \"real\" joggers (as in jogging material).\n",

      "Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).\r\n",

      "These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.\n",
      "I totally love this tank! the yoke detailing is so pretty! i read the other reviews...i feel it fits pretty tts, it's what i expected. i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail. i love it so much, i'm ordering it in the turquoise color as well. every time i have worn it, i have received compliments. i've worn it alone with shorts and/or jeans, as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work. it's soft, comfortable and to echo what another review stated, the material s\n",

      "First, the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green, it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds, whites, blues, pinks...virtually any color.\n",

      "This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.\n",
      "I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4\", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.\n",
      "Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.\r\n",

      "obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.\n",
      "First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.\n",
      "I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.\n",
      "I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .\n",
      "I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!\n",
      "These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.\n",
      "L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.\n",
      "I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).\n",

      "I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy\n",
      "I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4\", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try\n",

      "I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.\n",
      "I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!\n",
      "Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips.\n",
      "This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup, and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now, at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band, and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure, but it fits perfectly there for me.\n",

      "I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.\n",
      "This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei\n",

      "I had been eyeing these for a while, but as they didn't seem very popular, i figured i'd wait for a sale. i finally bought them at the 40% off of sale price (yay!) and i love them. they're extremely comfortable, and very flattering. i'd say they run true to size, but maybe on the smaller end of the size for the waist. the blue pants are more greenish in color than the picture shows, but still beautiful. i'm looking forward to wearing these now and into the spring.\n",
      "I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!\n",
      "Easy and fun jumper. runs slightly large. i ordered a medium and returned for a small. can be dressed up or down for a variety of occasions. would be perfect if it had pockets.\n",
      "This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.\n",
      "I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt, which emphasized my shape. unfortunately, it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.\n",
      "I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.\n",
      "This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.\n",
      "I was unsure about this dress when i first tried it on. the color is gorgeous, it is flowy and beautiful. it hits just below the knee (i am tall), which is something i am not used to. i hadn't decided on it, but my husband loves it and that's all that matters! it is very feminine and pretty. i normally wear a 0, but ordered a 00- it fits just slightly loose, which is the style this dress is going for.\n",
      "I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.\n",
      "These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6\" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28, which fits loosely, but comfortably.\n",
      "Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!\n",
      "I really wanted to like his dress, but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts, so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall, it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.\n",
      "Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person, i'm only 5'4\". really wanted to like this...\n",
      "The dress is cute, but i'm somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight. i guess we'll have to wait and see!\n",
      "I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!\n",
      "This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.\n",
      "Bought this for my daughter. it's adorable on her. we're going to take it in at the waist so it doesn't look so sack-like; then it'll be perfect!\n",
      "I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides \r\n",

      "Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro\n",
      "A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!\n",
      "This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i don't have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress.\n",
      "This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.\n",
      "I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.\n",
      "Just purchased this- love how light and airy it is. perfect for throwing on on a warm summer day. it is soft and comfy, but it does run pretty large. i am normally a m, and in this the m was swimming on me. i purchased the s, and still loose and flowy. i wore a strapless bra with it, but will also try a bandeau or tank top.\n",
      "I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)\n",
      "Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.\n",
      "I am 5'-7\" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length...\n",
      "This is one of those dresses that is just \"nice\" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it, it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but, it's a \"work horse\" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!\n",
      "This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.\n",
      "I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7\" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this \"in between\" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.\r\n",

      "I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7\" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.\n",
      "Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!\r\n",

      "I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4\" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.\n",
      "I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy\n",
      "Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.\n",
      "I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san\n",
      "I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.\n",
      "This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!\n",
      "I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!\n",
      "I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!\n",
      "Like a baby doll top, with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears, i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.\n",
      "This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2\" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips.\n",
      "I'm 5\"0\" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.\n",
      "Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!\n",
      "After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3\" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.\n",
      "I always look for things to hide \"parts\" without making my \"parts\" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.\n",
      "Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a \"box-like\" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.\r\n",
      "the material isn't what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light, somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.\r\n",
      "i am very happy with the color!\n",
      "This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!\n",
      "I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.\n",
      "This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.\n",
      "Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.\n",
      "Super cute and flattering shirt, the long tunic-style makes it so you can dress it up or down, so cute and comfy!\n",
      "It looks great on the model but not on me. on me, it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.\n",
      "This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.\n",
      "This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.\n",
      "If there ever was the perfect feminine dress, this would be it .\n",
      "I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put\n",
      "I had reservations about this top based on other reviews, but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin, but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.\n",
      "I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.\n",
      "I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.\n",
      "I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8\" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!\n",
      "I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!\n",
      "Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!\n",
      "I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3\" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.\n",
      "This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!\n",
      "I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.\n",
      "I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.\n",
      "I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!\n",
      "Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.\n",
      "I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.\n",
      "I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking\n",
      "I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5\" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are\n",
      "Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7\" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su\n",
      "Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.\n",
      "I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!\n",
      "I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10\" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to\n",
      "The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7\", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a \"pooch\", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung\n",
      "I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.\n",
      "I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh\n",
      "Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9\" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.\n",
      "This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable!\r\n",
      "my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos.\n",
      "I'm very pale, and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin, though.\n",
      "I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi\n",
      "I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.\n",
      "This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)\n",
      "This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!\n",
      "Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.\r\n",
      "this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!\n",
      "Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!\n",
      "Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.\n",
      "I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7\" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering\n",
      "Didn't work on this curvy gal.\r\n",
      "sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.\r\n",
      "major pass.\n",
      "The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building, but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist, the loose fit at the hips, and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would\n",
      "I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons, but i may be able to\n",
      "I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!\n",
      "This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!\r\n",
      "i would recommend this product\n",
      "Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!\n",
      "Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.\n",
      "This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.\n",
      "Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. \r\n",
      "retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.\n",
      "Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere\n",
      "Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.\n",
      "This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. \r\n",

      "the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim.\n",
      "This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore\n",
      "I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 \" shorter in front (i am 5'8\") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person.\n",
      "I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!\n",
      "I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3\"\n",
      "I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice.\n",
      "This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.\n",
      "Cute white t-shirt different style but didn't work on my body type so i returned it \r\n",
      " good price point \r\n",
      " basic fabric\n",
      "Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it.\n",
      "I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely\n",
      "I absolutely love this shirt! even though it has a large flowy design it looks wonderful. the print is so unique and will transition to autumn beautifully! i loved it so much i got both colors.\n",
      "I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3\" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:\r\n",

      "\n",
      "This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!\n",
      "I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4\" in the length and 2\" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on\n",
      "I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.\n",
      "I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store. i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it. it fits a little big -- definitely size down. but other than that, i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this. the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waist/tiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it, despite it being the perfect fabric for day. i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later.. it can be dre\n",
      "....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.\n",
      "This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6\" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!\n",
      "I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11\" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.\n",
      "I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.\n",
      "This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look \"thick\". highly recommend!\n",
      "I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so\n",
      "This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5\"1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!\n",
      "This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!\n",
      "I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe\n",
      "The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!\n",
      "Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer\n",
      "I loved this dress on. the material was quite different than expected, almost a canvas-y feel to it. ran a little large, but so cute.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.\n",
      "This top is absolutely adorable, fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.\n",
      "Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy, i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.\n",
      "Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5\", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.\n",
      "Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!\n",
      "Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist\n",
      "This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.\n",
      "This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.\n",
      "I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!\n",
      "Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase\n",
      "It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .\n",
      "Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.\n",
      "This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1\" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it\n",
      "In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!\n",
      "Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.\n",
      "An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.\n",
      "This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.\n",
      "The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.\n",
      "It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.\n",
      "For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir\n",
      "I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!\n",
      "This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down.\n",
      "This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.\n",
      "I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing.\n",
      "Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric, this is a great special occasion dress.\n",
      "I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.\n",
      "Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been\n",
      "These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.\n",
      "Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....\n",
      "I am reasonably petite, but i like sweaters very oversized and large, so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large, the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size, the sweater ended up looking very awkward, with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad\n",
      "I ordered the grey/yellow \"here comes the sun\" shirt. it's cute, but it runs quite large and isn't special enough for the price. meh.\n",
      "This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.\n",
      "I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin\n",
      "I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "sadly, dress had to be returned.\n",
      "I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great \"medium blue\" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2\" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!\n",
      "It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!\n",
      "it is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature.\n",
      "I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.\n",
      "I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6\" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo\n",
      "Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.\n",
      "Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.\n",
      "Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.\n",
      "I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding, and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress, the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.\n",
      "This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.\n",
      "Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well\n",
      "I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.\n",
      "Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. it is so cute! true to size, well made with a hint of tulle. super comfortable for moving and dancing. winner!\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w\n",
      "Very nice top, fits true to size, a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants\n",
      "It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.\n",
      "I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.\n",
      "I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.\n",
      "Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.\n",
      "Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.\n",
      "I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.\n",
      "I bought the \"here comes the sun\" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper.\n",
      "I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.\n",
      "Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!\n",
      "This is much more a blouse than a \"tee\". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up.\n",
      "I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!\n",
      "This runs way big.  i would recommend sizing down at least one size.  possibly 2.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i got the design with divers.  it's fun and light for summer.  soft material and very comfy.\n",
      "Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.\n",
      "Wished this had worked for me! however, i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin (not so young anymore) don't show. the beige lining shows at the armholes as well. on the upside, it's very slimming even with the stiff petticoat. so cute! perfect length for me. another caveat -- if your back is not completely symmetrical, as mine isn't, the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position. i'm 98 lbs, 4' 10\", and the oop was perfect but for the above objections.\n",
      "The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites, but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well, if not better, depending on the length of the outfit!\r\n",
      "______________\r\n",
      "pros:\r\n",
      "- looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.\r\n",
      "- well made, good stitching, solid dress.\r\n",
      "- great length in the sleeves.\r\n",
      "- fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my\n",
      "Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too \"cutsie\" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!\n",
      "This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10\", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.\n",
      "This is a really flattering tee for my curves. pretty lace details. i purchased the gray and ordered the wine. the pink looked more peach to me in the store. only reason for 4 stars is that the back material wrinkles easily. true to size (large) for me.\n",
      "Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!\n",
      "I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.\n",
      "I\"m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.\n",
      "For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.\r\n",
      "the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.\r\n",
      "no need to say - it's going back asap.\r\n",
      "you should not sel\n",
      "I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and i'm 5'1\". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it\n",
      "Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s\n",
      "I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!\n",
      "I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!\n",
      "I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.\n",
      "Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.\n",
      "Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.\n",
      "Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions.\n",
      "I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.\n",
      "Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!\n",
      "I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2\" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.\n",
      "I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it\n",
      "Gorgeous fun dress, but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra, but i think its a winner for someone.\n",
      "I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!\n",
      "Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed.\n",
      "Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.\n",
      "I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i\n",
      "This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.\n",
      "This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.\n",
      "Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.\n",
      "I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!\n",
      "Very pretty but also very roomy. i'm using it as a swimsuit cover up, so it's perfect!\n",
      "I ordered these in my typical size, 26, and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me, i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made, i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3\" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try, hopefully they work better for you.\n",
      "I tried on the xs in the store (115 lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or\n",
      "This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2\"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!\n",
      "This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5\"1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me\r\n",
      "definitely a keeper!\n",
      "This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5\"1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!\n",
      "I ordered this in the \"plum\" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5\", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou\n",
      "The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.\n",
      "This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4\" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric\n",
      "This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely.\n",
      "This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.\n",
      "Dress is very pretty, but very short, almost tunic length.\n",
      "I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this dress on way more than i expected to - the pictures don't do it justice. the fabric is soft and is a really nice weight - heavier than i expected, which makes the dress hang in a really flattering way. the belt doesn't go all the way around, as other reviewers said, but i actually kind of like it that way. i almost didn't try it on based on some of the other reviews, but i'm sooooo glad i did. it's a really cute dress - will look great as is, or with a light cardigan if it's a littl\n",
      "I like the style, but i ordered an extra small (i am5'4' 120#) and it was still too loose fitting on me, had to return, hopefully exchange for xxs\n",
      "I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2\". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!\n",
      "I'm a big fan of paige jeans. these are perfect for my petite frame. at 5\"3' they were ankle length. i tried my normal paige size and ultimately sized up for a better fit at the waist.\n",
      "This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.\n",
      "This is, like many reviewers stated, a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great, because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm, only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me, and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young, too trendy? i don't know, when you're in your 40s, you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel\n",
      "I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!\n",
      "I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.\n",
      "The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. \r\n",
      "sending back\n",
      "I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.\n",
      "I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.\n",
      "I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however, i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least, so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2), the regular length doesn't fall right, the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite.\n",
      "Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!\n",
      "This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.\n",
      "Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.\n",
      "This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7\" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.\n",
      "Perfection! i am 5'3\"/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!\n",
      "Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3\" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#.\n",
      "Love the style of this dress (length, hem, waist details, material)! i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around. it doesn't give the entire waist definition, which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist. this is a pretty unique dress, which is one of the reasons i liked it. i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps. unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea\n",
      "So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5\"6\" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful. it is longer than it looks on the model (i'm 5/5) but drapes beautifully. it is perfect for a wedding or a special event. i love it!\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau\n",
      "This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2\" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.\n",
      "This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it.\n",
      "The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3\" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high.\n",
      "I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt, but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat, which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious\n",
      "Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)\n",
      "Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a nice shirt, but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute\n",
      "I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.\r\n",
      "the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.\n",
      "Hi ladies,\r\n",
      "does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do\n",
      "I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!\n",
      "This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.\n",
      "Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.\n",
      "Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.\n",
      "This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.\n",
      "I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall, i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...\n",
      "You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?\n",
      "I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.\n",
      "Great fit and design but the wool is too itchy and rough. will need a layer underneath\n",
      "This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.\n",
      "While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!\n",
      "Slighty fitted, flattering, very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color.\n",
      "I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not \"baggy\" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)\n",
      "I loved the color and the style of the sleeves.  it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didn't end up keeping it\n",
      "Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.\n",
      "This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.\n",
      "I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.\n",
      "I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark\n",
      "Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.\n",
      "Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.\n",
      "I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!\n",
      "Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.\n",
      "I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.\n",
      "I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear\n",
      "I am 5'8 with curvy, muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.\n",
      "Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3\") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!\n",
      "I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered 2 sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.\n",
      "This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!\n",
      "I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn\n",
      "Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.\n",
      "I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it\n",
      "I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the \"skirt\" is adorable.\n",
      "I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2\") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid\n",
      "This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy.\n",
      "I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos\n",
      "I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.\n",
      "I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.\n",
      "I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod\n",
      "Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4\". i usually wear a size 12 or 32\" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:(\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful - \r\n",
      "usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.\n",
      "Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.\n",
      "Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!\n",
      "Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!\n",
      "I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is \"blah\", average.\n",
      "\n",
      "the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color\n",
      "I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price.\n",
      "It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.\n",
      "I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top\n",
      "This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.\n",
      "I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6\" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.\n",
      "Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in\n",
      "I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside\n",
      "Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans .\n",
      "I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th\n",
      "This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.\n",
      "Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.\n",
      "Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2\", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.\n",
      "This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.\n",
      "This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.\n",
      "Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s\n",
      "Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!\n",
      "I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.\n",
      "Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.\n",
      "Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.\n",
      "Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.\n",
      "I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!\n",
      "The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1\", 100 lbs and i can carry it off.\n",
      "This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.\n",
      "I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.\n",
      "Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.\n",
      "I fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size m/l. on first wearing with slim jeans, booties and a long sleeved t, the body of the vest was fine. but with wavy shoulder-length hair, i found the large, wide collar overwhelming at the top. i tried folding the collar under, as in the photo of the gray one, but still too much. i altered it by paring it down by 7 inches at the back neck, and tapering down to meet the lapel at mid-chest. the fabric looks like boiled wool, but is actually a tigh\n",

      "it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10. \r\n",
      "it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful\n",
      "I loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my 34 dd chest so back it goes. the zipper had one spot where it was tight, right at the widest part of my rib cage. it was fine every where else. too bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this blouse on sale in a medium because it was the last one left in the store. i usually wear a large, but surprisingly it fit. i'm a woman of color, and the off white and lace looks great with my complexion. i got many compliments on the blouse as i made my way to the register to check out. i can't wait to wear it this spring. i'll have to be careful when wearing this blouse because one good snag with a fingernail, or necklace and the lace will be torn. other than that, i'm very happy\n",
      "These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!\n",
      "I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!\n",
      "Love this sweater. fun for fall. soft fabric and runs true to size. will look great with jeans or dress pants.\n",
      "The weave is very loose and chunky which i like but isn't so apparent in the picture. also the sleeves bell more than it looks like on the model. the color is a great caramel and it fit tts. i think it will be great on cooler days.\n",
      "Love this sweater, do wish i sized up for a little longer length, but works great with high rise pants.  comfy and great color\n",
      "I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu\n",
      "With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:\n",

      "- very slimming.\n",
      "- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi\n",
      "This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized, playful, chic, dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.\n",
      "I saw this sweater online and had to try it. i went to my local retailer to try it on and i'm glad i did. i am usually a xs - s in tops and i thought this fit best in a medium. it's very chunky which is what i was looking for and so soft - not scratchy at all. it has wide bell sleeves, but that's very on trend right now. i am 5'4, 34b and it falls about an inch below the top of my jeans. it's not form fitting but so snugly. i plan on wearing it with dark denim skinnies, booties, and simple jewlery\n",
      "I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.\n",
      "These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.\n",
      "This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.\n",
      "I adore this sweater. it is so soft and cozy. i ordered two because i really need some good winter sweaters that are forgiving on the pooch but not wool (darn allergies). so i ordered this in the white and black (camel is a bad color for me).\r\n",

      "I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, \" give it a chance\". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi\n",
      "This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!\r\n",

      "i highly recommend it!\n",
      "The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b, 150 5' 9\", tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.\n",
      "This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee\n",

      "Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.\n",
      "Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5\",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! .\n",
      "This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5\".\n",

      "I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so\n",
      "What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a \"go-to\" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!\n",

      "This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).\n",
      "This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.\n",
      "I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.\n",
      "Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that's what i usually wear.\n",
      "This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i\n",
      "Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.\n",
      "I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.\n",

      "If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.\n",
      "I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.\n",
      "I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.\n",
      "I'm so glad the other reviewer also found these small. literally, the largest size i have ever bought. but the style is really cute, sort of dapper british boy...\n",
      "Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.\n",
      "So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats,\r\n",
      "extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6\" and the length is just slightly cropped.\n",
      "I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5\", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red.\n",
      "Great dress, fit perfectly warm for the winter, i live in florida it will be great if we get a winter next year. very comfortable and easy to wear.\n",
      "Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus\n",
      "Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long.\n",
      "I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.\n",
      "I love these pants! beautiful quality material, soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design, and really fun!\n",
      "i am 5 foot 5, and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped, so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips, but they aren't .\n",
      "I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and, although, i'm not a huge fan of gauze, the fit was perfect.  i had to\r\n",
      "snatch it!\n",
      "I&#39;ve been looking for comfortable pants that i could wear to work and at home.  these fit the bill.  i bought these in the holly color for the fall and winter.  they are super soft and very comfortable.  i was worried that they would like dumpy, especially around the seat area, but they fit fine.\n",
      "However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...\n",
      "Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall\n",
      "Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.\n",
      "This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!\n",
      "I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma\n",
      "This dress is comfortable and versatile - one could wear it to the office or to a social event, day to night. i didn't find the sizing to run as large as some of the other reviewers did. i felt it was true to size. it is not lined so you would need a slip under it if you wear it with tights or nylons, otherwise the skirt will cling.\n",
      "Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately, there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin, this is a beauty.\n",
      "I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on\n",
      "These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!\n",
      "Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants\n",
      "Unlike other reviewers, i found these pants to run true to size (in my case, my usual 6) or even a tad roomy. the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties. i appreciate the belt loops!\n",
      "Decent quality. i am 5'4\" 130 pounds. m is too big. runs slightly large.\n",
      "Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though.\n",
      "These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.\n",
      "highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be\n",
      "I bought these on a whim, patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well, look great and i had lots of compliments.\n",
      "This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.\n",
      "I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.\n",
      "This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.\n",
      "Beautiful patterns and colors, but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way, but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out.\n",
      "I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!\n",
      "I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:\n",
      "_________________\n",
      "pros:\n",
      "- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.\n",
      "- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)\n",
      "- the length is ideal for taller folk.\n",
      "- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.\n",
      "- nicely conservative at the top.\n",

      "cons:\n",
      "- i\n",
      "I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.\n",
      "Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!\n",
      "Beautiful colors\n",
      "This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc\n",
      "This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.\n",
      "This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable, with gorgeous embroidered detailing, but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4\" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio, i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist, the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened.\n",
      "This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10\" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!\n",
      "I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!\n",
      "\n",
      "This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.\n",
      "Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!\n",
      "The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.\n",
      "These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.\n",
      "I really wanted to not like the top for that price, but ti looks really good, the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p, not sure what size to get, and it is just fine. the length is almost too short, but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide, like poofing out a bit, perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer, but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also, teh colla\n",
      "Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!\n",
      "Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!\n",
      "I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t\n",
      "This shirt is so great. it's beautiful and functional. i received countless compliments the first time i wore it. i'm looking forward to wearing it again! worth the steep price, though it was hard to justify.\n",
      "Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4\" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t\n",
      "The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.\n",
      "This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!\n",
      "I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality\n",
      "I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.\n",
      "This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.\n",
      "I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6\", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.\n",
      "I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely, but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned, this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well, i also didn't love the collar, which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po\n",
      "This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to\n",
      "Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning.\n",
      "Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!\r\n",

      "Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!\n",
      "The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic\n",
      "I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.\n",
      "I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.\n",
      "It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but\n",
      "Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you\n",
      "Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.\n",
      "When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning, it was just so elegant and the details are perfection. \"till i tried it on and had some reservations. the sleeves (at the top) were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them. and as a taller gal, i wish it were a tad longer (in the model shot, looks a bit short from the back view). i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work\n",
      "This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it.\n",
      "I ordered this shirt last week, it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs ,i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors, i'd order another one in a minute!\n",
      "So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if\n",
      "Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.\n",
      "I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!\n",
      "I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s\n",
      "This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.\n",
      "Great t. great lightweight, almost linen like fabric. a bit on the sheer side, but love the fit and the neckline!\n",
      "I bought this for my mother and she really loves it. it is a bit on the large side for her but have decided to keep it. the quality seems very good and great styling for a washable item! i actually like it so much i may order one for myself!\n",
      "I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9\" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized \"boyfriend\" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol\n",
      "Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.\n",
      "I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3\" 112 lbs and the small\n",
      "I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4\" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.\n",
      "I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors.\n",
      "This was what i was looking for ! the little stripes ,black and white color,the shape of the jacket and skirt together....well perfect. kind of. i purchased this entire ensemble. the skirt was going to be shortened because well i'm short. no problem ,this is a common occurrence for me. but the jacket would not work for me. the sleeves were way too tight for my muscular arms. there was no way the adorable shirt would fit in there. the shirt is adorable by the way. all of these pieces are made ver\n",
      "This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top.\n",
      "These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l\n",

      "I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great, and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious, soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition, the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it, then this morning went to have another look at it, wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this\n",
      "This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person, the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft, though. returned it!\n",

      "This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6\", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the \"boxy\" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be\n",
      "This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy, which i love. the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft! can't wait to wear it with a t-shirt and jeans!\n",
      "I bought this shirt in the rust color along with the blue/black sweater skirt after seeing it on display in the store. not sure i would have ever put those 2 together but i love the outfit. i'm not much of a shirt-tucker, either, but this shirt works either way. tucked in a skirt or more casual with jeans. my only criticism is the static cling in the front, as mentioned by another reviewer. i had thought of getting it in white, but if it's shear, then maybe not. haven't been wearing a tank under\n",
      "The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-34 d with arms that aren't tiny, and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much\n",
      "Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went.\n",
      "I tried this top because i loved the not so simple, simpleness of it. however, it was a miss for me. loved the fit and style, which i'd say is pretty true to size, i just didn't love the color on me. i went for the orange one and the color was a bit too bright for my liking. cute top though! for reference i'm a usually small, i'm 5'4\" and a small fit perfectly.\n",

      "I am short, on the heavy side. 5'1\" 156 lbs. i always wear large petite. this beautiful blouse swallows me. lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt, causing a boxy look. i could totally do a mp if not sp. i am going to try and exchange..\n",

      "Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)\n",
      "Adore the rust color in this top. very pretty rust color. would go with a lot of stuff. my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye. i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath. but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect, drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix. beautiful on. felt that it fit tts. i'm usually a 34b, got an xs in this top.\n",
      "This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.\n",
      "I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 125 lbs) i can wear it with a c\n",
      "This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!\n",
      "This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted.\n",
      "I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer, will shrink.\n",

      "The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.\n",
      "Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.\n",
      "This is a very cute, casual sweater. i originally ordered a size medium but i had to send it back because it was way too large all over. i recently received the size small and i'm going to keep it. it is still a roomy fit but the overall design of the sweater is a relaxed fit. the color combination and texture of this sweater is lovely.\n",

      "Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up \"is she or isn't she\" kind of way.\n",
      "This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight\n",
      "I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).\n",
      "The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!\n",
      "I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.\n",
      "The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape.\n",
      "These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!\n",
      "I really like this vest. personally, i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short, especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that\n",
      "I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev\n",
      "I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy\n",
      "Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite, way too much fabric. returned.\n",

      "Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.\n",
      "At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of\n",

      "Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable, the length is great, and the rise, at least for me, is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro.\n",
      "This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!\n",
      "This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist, tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts, but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.\n",
      "I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. \r\n",

      "These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9\" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels.\n",
      "The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized , therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders , the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .\n",

      "i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt. \r\n",

      "I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.\n",
      "I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the\n",
      "I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.\n",

      "I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.\r\n",

      "I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the \"back view\" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear.\n",
      "Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.\n",
      "I love the style of this dress, but unfortunately, it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also, the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.\n",
      "This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders, i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the\n",
      "When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!\n",
      "This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.\n",

      "I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short, i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.\n",

      "/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.\n",
      "Love this button down, but i couldn't make it work. i'm 5'4\", 32b, and usually buy tops in a regular xs or s. i bought this top in a small and it was loose fitting which i liked, but too long for me causing the pleats to flare out more than i liked. the shirt is also pretty sheer, wear a skin colored bra unless you want it noticed. the material was soft and looked like good quality.\n",
      "I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.\n",
      "Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a \"true\" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it \"opening\" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed.\n",
      "I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.\n",
      "Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!\n",
      "This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it, which is awesome, and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also, the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.\n",
      "I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there's\n",
      "This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6\", 145 lbs, 34dd.\n",
      "Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.\n",
      "The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.\n",
      "This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!\n",
      "Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.\n",
      "I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there\n",
      "This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.\n",

      "Unexpected delight! great top that can be dressed up or down. the only con is a little small through the bust.\n",
      "Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.\n",
      "The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. \r\n",
      "bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s\n",
      "I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4\", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops).\n",
      "I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.\n",
      "So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!\n",
      "Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5\"2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9\". hope this helps!\n",
      "I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!\n",
      "Super cute and flattering!\n",
      "First, i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering, forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it, and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together\n",
      "Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6\", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a\n",
      "This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu\n",
      "Buy this skit- it's everything that retailer used to be. great pice, work appopriate, and it fits great.\n",
      "Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!\n",
      "I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.\n",
      "I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!\n",
      "This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.\n",
      "I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect! \r\n",
      "i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an \"x\" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.\n",
      "Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)\n",
      "I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!\n",
      "This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!\n",
      "This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.\n",
      "This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.\n",
      "I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi\n",
      "This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back.\n",
      "Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt \"damp\" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.\r\n",
      "and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the \"v\" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither \"flat chested\" nor \"busty\"\n",
      "I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.\n",
      "This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece.\n",
      "I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!\n",
      "So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.\r\n",
      "fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good, sleeves are a not too tight.\n",
      "It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water, line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water\n",
      "Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.\n",
      "I'm so excited about this dress! it's perfect for the summer. the material is so soft and lightweight, with a great lining. i ordered a small petite and it fits great! the ruching in the front isn't overdone, so you don't have to worry about adding bulk in the midsection. no problem with my bra (32dd) showing in the back either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.\n",
      "This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.\n",
      "This is a beautiful sweater, but if came up weirdly high on me in back, higher than it looks on the model. she must have on high waisted pants.\n",
      "Super long even at 5'7\" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me, so even at the sale price they're going back.\n",
      "I was so excited to order this dress, had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.\n",
      "These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.\n",
      "Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.\n",
      "Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.\n",
      "130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres\n",
      "As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!\n",
      "I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.\n",
      "The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov\n",
      "I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2\", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.\n",
      "I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the \"brocade\" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret\n",
      "This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8\", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.\n",
      "I love this top! fits true to size. tunic length, thin comfy fabric, adorable subtle print. the perfect top!\n",
      "This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb, just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work, or be a different hue in real life, but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!\n",
      "I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however, the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it, so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!\n",
      "This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june, but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location, but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p\n",
      "Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2\" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!\n",
      "Lovely assemblage of prints, looks great in motion. but the waistband runs a touch large. if you're between sizes, maybe size down.\n",
      "The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.\n",
      "I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3\", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze\n",
      "If you happen to get a size that fits you, you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair, both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also, not sure who named these colors, but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.\n",
      "Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size\n",
      "I've been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try. i ordered the blue color on-line in size 31. i'm somewhat in-between size 30 and 31 in jeans right now, so i thought i'd be on the safe side and go up. i ended up keeping these and i'm happy with my purchase, although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me. i am a proportional hour-glass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh, while being oversized in the waist.\n",
      "in the end,\n",
      "I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.\n",
      "Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit, but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall, winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f\n",
      "I ordered a petite small. i'm 5'3, 135 lbs and 34b and the length was perfect and the fit was great. like the previous reviews. love you can wear a bra with it.\n",
      "I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.\n",
      "Soft, comfy, flattering, just a beautiful dress. it works for any occasion. i can't express how much i love it!\n",
      "I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall\n",
      "The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5\" and the small fit perfectly.\n",
      "I have been searching for great bra friendly maxis and the design and colors of this one are exactly what i was looking for. i love how the front and back dip down and the open back with crossover detail is really sleek looking.  overall, it's tts, but the chest is a little low cut, so some will want to size up for extra coverage.  the fabric is a silky jersey made of mostly rayon (95%) and spandex (5%) with a mesh nylon/spandex lining from the top through where the cream color ends at the botto\n",
      "Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.\n",
      "I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6\"\n",
      "Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you\n",
      "This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.\n",
      "I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say\n",
      "This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.\n",
      "I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.\n",
      "These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all\n",
      "These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.\n",
      "I really like this pullover. the design is beautiful, and i love the asymmetrical hem. my own complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy on me because i'm large-chested. it's more drapey than tailored. but it's not overwhelming and doesn't cancel out how much i like it overall.\n",
      "The flow and feel of the material is really nice, however, i think it runs large. i ordered a small, and i have exchanged it for an xs, which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there.\n",
      "This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery, colors, crochet lace, tassels, wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.\n",
      "I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3\" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium\n",
      "True to size. length is perfect for 5'8\"-5'9\". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty.\n",
      "This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2\",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr\n",
      "I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3\" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?\n",
      "I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.\n",
      "Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!\n",
      "This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1\", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4\") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re\n",
      "I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...\n",
      "This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.\n",
      "I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4\", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.\n",
      "I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5\" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.\n",
      "This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.\n",
      "These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.\n",
      "\n",
      "i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.\n",
      "The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!\n",
      "I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!\n",
      "Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.\n",
      "I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!\n",
      "I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.\n",
      "As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big \"thank you\" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3\" ordered size\n",
      "I am just over 5'8\"and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.\n",
      "Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.\n",
      "Love these pants. super light and great color. they are a bit long though\n",
      "Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.\n",

      "I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3\", but it fe\n",

      "I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.\n",
      "These jeans are well-made, the cut is decently flattering, but on more muscular thighs, it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle, so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height), then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small, but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall, ok but returning them.

      "i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)\n",
      "I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them,. i exchanged for the next size up, because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store, i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.\n",
      "I love love love the fit in the corduroy, so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well, just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans, and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!\n",
      "I love this shirt, it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter.\n",
      "Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th\n",
      "I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love\n",
      "These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how \"modern\" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and\n",
      "I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5\"2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches .\n",

      "bohemian/gothic.\r\n",
      "the style, fabric and overall design/quality of this dress, is something i felt she would like (even though the color is not black).\r\n",
      "she loves it - perfect fit. she accessorized it with her usual biker/moto jacket,boots, etc.\r\n",
      "but it looks awesome on her!\n",
      "This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.\n",
      "Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty, but the shape isn't flattering, at least not to me. might work better on a teen?\n",
      "Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.\n",
      "I'm keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it's such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don't need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it.\n",
      "I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful, soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1\", 102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!\n",
      "I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav\n",
      "I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.\n",
      "These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)\r\n",
      "would highly recommend them.\n",
      "I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my \"go to\" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of\n",
      "1. i'm 5'5\" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly.\n",
      "Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.\n",
      "The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!\n",
      "These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.\n",
      "I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however, given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals, 30.5 is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also, i wish the coral and green came in petite.\n",
      "Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!\n",
      "I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10\", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly.\n",
      "Nice length in tall.  order up one size: cut slim in body.  fabric lightweight bordering on flimsy.\n",
      "The retailer store had mostly white left of these pilcro linen pants so i tried them on. the main reason i did not leave the store with them is because i could see the washing tag inside the pants as clear as day. the white pants were just too see-through and i was really looking for some casual items to wear to the office. if it was at least lined, these pants would have come home with me. otherwise, i think the fit was tts.\n",
      "I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.\n",
      "These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or \"girlfriends'\" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend\n",
      "I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7\" and 133 lb and got a size 4.\n",
      "This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!\n",
      "i am 5'4\" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.\n",
      "the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.\n",
      "These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6\" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.\n",
      "It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the\n",
      "I own this shirt in dark green,\n",
      "navy, and white.\n",
      "it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.\n",
      "it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.\n",
      "and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).\n",
      "well done!\n",
      "I like the feel and color of this blouse. however, i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse, it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the \"curve\" is not even visible when i wear it.\n",
      "I love these jeans and have been wearing them a lot now that the weather is turning a bit cooler in my area. i like that the cuff is not sewn in, so you can wear them with a cuff like pictured, or fully unrolled/down. they are a bit higher-waisted than i prefer - kind of an awkward waist height in my opinion. and they are very stretchy. i was torn between two sizes so i went with the larger. i wasn't sure of how to mark how they fit because they are somewhat fitted/slim in the thigh area, but th\n",
      "Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.\n",
      "I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!\n",
      "This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt.\n",
      "Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.\n",
      "So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.\n",
      "It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.\n",
      "I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great.\n",
      "I like many of you had the same issues. i tried my normal size of xs and s and couldn't get it on. the sales associate looked at it and went and got several size small and they all fit differently. some fit normal and others did not, so i would try on first. i love it when it fits correctly\n",
      "I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.\n",
      "Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.\n",
      "You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!\n",
      "Really cute skirt, but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy, so if you got them, forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt.\n",
      "Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!\n",
      "This is a beautiful sweater! it is not too heavy and the variation in knit from front to back makes not the same old boring sweater. the color is gorgeous.\n",
      "I would definitely only recommend this top to girls who are smaller chested. it fits in the shoulders/arms, and then flares out too much at the bottom, almost looks like a maternity top. the material is very nice however - both soft, and feels like it will hold up through multiple washes.\n",
      "I just love this dress! the color, the quality, the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews, and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top, so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into.\n",
      "I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2\" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!\n",
      "I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen\n",
      "This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha\n",
      "This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.\n",
      "I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.\n",
      "I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6\" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in\n",
      "Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made, but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews, and it's too large, and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick, (5'5, 105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips, making me look a little curvier, which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing, and this piece will spruce up most outfits !\n",
      "Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern, however, the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.\n",
      "Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking\n",

      "Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8\", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.\n",
      "Okay, i get the idea of the loose swing dresses but i have a couple that do it well without looking like a moo-moo. i ordered my \"typical\" pxs. the length was good and the color beautiful. i like the details of the dress but it was huge and not in a flattering swingy drapey way. i was undecided if i should try the pxxs as the pxs was so large that i don't know if the pxxs would fix this problem for me. i will still be thinking about it.\n",
      "Dear creatures always has sizing issues. they run the gamut of bust-problems. i'd been salivating for this dress for a long time so i really did my homework. at 5'7\", 130-135 lbs, 34c, 28\" waist - typically a 4 in dresses... i bought the small. each dress is cut from the same fabric, leaving each dress's color swatch placement to be randomly determined. as a result, i've seen some dresses have only pink, purple, and green. i lucked out and got every color represented. so the dress you see may no\n",
      "Fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores. whimsical but work--appropriate. i'm typically a 4 in dresses. i would say this skirt runs tts; however, the front pleats will create a pouch-y stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anything-below-your-waist. size up one size to avoid this. the waist size will be loose, but it will allow the pleats to lay flat. absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top. also great with solid white, black, or printed blouses. not a true pen\n",
      "This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.\n",
      "This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!\n",

      "This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.\n",

      "I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer\"s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,\n",
      "I adore this dress, the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it, but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe, so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress\n",
      "One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede\n",
      "Love the deep purple color of this cardi sweater - long and drapey looks great with leggings skinnies and jeans. my only problem is the way the loose stitching around the cuffs is makes it worrisome. wore once and already starting to get a hole. still a great piece.\n",
      "Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!\n",
      "I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.\n",
      "This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca\n",
      "I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.\n",
      "Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami\n",
      "This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin\n",

      "- the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "- the style is decidedly casual and \"slouchy\". it looks great with jeans, but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.\n",
      "What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.\n",
      "This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2\" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......\n",

      "I loved this top . it is beautiful.\n",
      "The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.\n",
      "So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.\n",
      "Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.\n",
      "Cute dress that is perfect for a casual summer wedding or brunch with friends. i love the material and that the dress is lined. it is very comfortable and it has pockets. this is definitely more of a ?golden? yellow vs. a soft yellow. my only complaint is that i wish it were cinched more right below the bust. it would give the dress (and me) more shape. i would say this dress is true to size but if you have a larger chest, you will likely want to size up. if you have a small chest, i would proba\n",

      "Very soft fabric. does begin to ball up due to boucle material, very common\n",
      "These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels.\n",
      "Loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large. i am usually a size 6 or m and the legs were a little baggy w/the medium. since the m is sold out i'm going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer. the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus. i'm 5'7\" and they are the perfect length.\n",

      "The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!\n",
      "Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight, allows no room for extra tummy, hips, booty, or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top), but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m, would have definitely sized up, as i really liked the look.\n",
      "I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5\" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts\n",
      "Beautiful, unique, colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale, this is a no-brainer\n",
      "The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.\n",

      "This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect, falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5\" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly, which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip, to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra\n",
      "This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!\n",
      "Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36\" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made.\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!\n",
      "I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye\n",

      "There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.\n",
      "Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.\n",
      "These jeans are awesome! i usually wear a 26 in ag jeans as they tend to stretch, but i ordered a 27p because i am only 5'1 and these are a flare style. i have a small waist but a larger booty, and these jeans hug me in all the right places. they also have a great dark color and are super classy so you can dress them up if need be. the only thing i didn't like was the length. even with the petite size i have to wear wedges so they don't drag on the ground. but, this is an issue i have with most\n",
      "I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.\n",
      "Even on sale, this was just too pricey for what it is, which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps, but it hangs very wide off your chest.\n",

      "This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.\n",
      "This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it's casual yet dressy at the same time. \r\n",

      "This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!\n",
      "I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.\n",
      "I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes, perfect for me.\n",
      "I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it, either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure, (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.\n",
      "Went to the store in search of a butter dish. tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable, versatile and all over appealing this dress is. i'm 5'10\" and the medium hits at my knees.  as always i think the quality could be better. it's not something that will last for years.\n",
      "I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big, so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow, what an outfit!!!!\r\n",
      "then i washed it according to directions, and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.\n",
      "This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable, stylish, and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring, summer, and fall.\n",

      "I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.\r\n",

      "I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short\n",
      "I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right, not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits\n",
      "Dig this top but a little different from what i was expecting. the outside is indeed a bit stiff and scratchy but it is lined ... but definitely would've appreciated a softer fabric. however, the cut is cute and flattering and the pattern is adorable so it's staying in my closet. perhaps not the thing to wear to snuggle up with someone though!\n",
      "I purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it's a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them\n",
      "I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!\n",
      "I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5\".\n",

      "I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit, i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!\n",
      "Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :)\n",
      "This jacket is gorgeous! the design is visually very interesting. the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day.\n",
      "Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t\n",
      "\n",
      "I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!\n",
      "I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def\n",
      "I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu\n",
      "I love everything about this blouse except for one thing: the peplum just hits way too high up on the body, and i am only 5'4\". 106 and ordered a regular size 2 (not petite) which fits perfectly except for this. it is made of a beautiful textured fabric and is very nice quality. i adore peplums and own many and like the peplum to begin near the waist. however, others may not mind the higher waist and in that case it may work for them. i really hated to send it back it was so pretty but it just w\n",
      "Super cute, flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(\n",
      "I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.\n",
      "I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u\n",
      "I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and\n",
      "Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!\n",

      "I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6, 128 lbs with some boobs, usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs, and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose, hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy, and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips, plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon\n",
      "This dress is comfortable and the pattern is really nice with some good attention to detail on the lace trim and pockets. i ordered this in my usual pxs (i am 5'2\"), but this definitely runs very large. it is a shirt style dress so i didn't expect it to be fitted, but off the hanger it was just too shapeless and sack-like for me. i really wanted it to work, so i took it to my tailor and she added a beautiful navy rope-like tie attached to both sides in the back of the dress. it looks amazing, an\n",
      "This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you can't tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2\", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri\n",

      "I bought this dress in the green. it runs big - i usually take a s and had to return for xs - i am 5'5\" and 125. it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops. worth every penny!!\n",
      "For a brand called \"tiny\"--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades, so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--\"too big!\", \"too small!\"--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty, and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities, just putting them together in a wearable size seems t\n",
      "This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.\n",
      "This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.\n",
      "I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also, it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem, i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.\n",
      "I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.\n",
      "This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all.\n",
      "Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.\n",
      "I feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest. i am 5/9\" and the m'l is the perfect length and size. i was initially attracted by the external seams (and color) and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric. it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy. .\n",
      "This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color\n",
      "This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.\n",

      "This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7\" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight.\n",
      "Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!\n",

      "I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec\n",

      "I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.\n",
      "Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side, but i read that many others had the opposite problem, particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me, it looks and feels great.\n",
      "Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.\n",
      "I love, love, love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver, and when it finally went up, the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress, which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.\n",

      "I'm not usually a fan of simple crewneck sweaters but this one has some nice added details that make it a keeper. the dark red oxblood color is really nice (it manages to be a red sweater without feeling overly holiday), the detailing at shoulder/chest is interesting yet subtle enough to not be distracting and doesn't feel bulky at all, the dropped shoulder seams are done correctly and without the body becoming boxy. it does feel like it might run a tad bit large, but only very slightly, not eno\n",

      "I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8\", typical size 6.\n",
      "This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size, but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout, it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i'm 5'9\" and the dress falls to my ankles, but that's ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th\n",
      "I fell in love with this cute top, however after reading reviews, i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me, sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.\n",
      "Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.\n",

      "But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.\n",
      "I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom, but whoa... even when sizing up, i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable, and if you have a smaller bust, it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.\n",
      "This vest is soft, flattering, and versatile. but both pockets were sewn incorrectly, with broken seams on the bottoms so if you used them, things would fall out. i'm keeping it but had to pay a seamstress to fix it. for the price, i'd expect better quality. recommended conditionally..\n",

      "I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.\n",
      "I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!\n",
      "I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.\n",
      "I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.\n",
      "I have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small. i'm 5'8, an athletic pear with narrow shoulders, 34c, and usually a 6 in tops at retailer. since the top looks a little short on the model, i sized up to an 8, since i'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer. i'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip, and if it were any smaller, it'd be too tight in my chest. since it doesn't stretch, you need some space for your arms to move. if i could do it again, i'd actually si\n",
      "I ordered the gray/plum colorway and while i'm disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication, the vest is very soft and warm. the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and i'm tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look. i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave.\n",
      "Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3\" 140# 36dd.\n",
      "Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.\n",
      "Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3\" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great\n",
      "Wanted to love this top, and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place, accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled, although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am, so back it goes. i am 5'7\", 160lbs, 34dddd, and the size large was the correct size.\n",
      "This is the perfect dress! for summer, fall, winter or spring, it is flattering and looks cute with booties, flip flops, brogues or barefoot! runs a teeny bit large - i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect! i might just buy the other color it comes in!!!!\n",
      "I bought this top and it ran huge, i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad, i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.\n",
      "For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.\n",
      "This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it's really comfortable and fun, too!\n",

      "with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5\", 130, and have a small bust.\n",
      "I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.\n",

      "I love a good peplum top, and was so excited when it arrived, but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering, because in every other way, it fit like a dream, but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.\n",
      "This top is super cute and is very flattering. however, i have trouble getting in and out of it. there is one zipper on the side but it almost seems like it needs to go higher up in order to help you put it on and take it off.\n",
      "This dress is very striking, especially in the green color way i purchased. flow and loose, very feminine but not \"cute\". well made and very much in style this season. i returned it because it wasn't quite suitable for me-1 size up would have been a better. fit overall.\n",
      "I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5\", 112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.\n",
      "I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.\n",
      "This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3\" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !\n",
      "I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).\n",
      "I absolutely love this tee! i normally don't buy two of the same thing, but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale. i ordered a size small, and it fits tts. it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans/cords. i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best. it's very slimming and so soft.\n",
      "This tee is amazing! it is so soft and comfortable. and is great for those of us who are tall, it has great length! i went with a medium because i didn't want it too tight. i really hope that retailer restocks soon because i want to buy one in every color!\n",
      "Super comfortable!! i am 34 weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also!\n",
      "Like the other reviewers, this is my new favorite tee. it's so freaking soft, and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare. pure+good has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while, and i will definitely be buying more colors in this. the length is perfect for leggings, and it would be cute with jeans too.\n",

      "Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca\n",
      "Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.\n",
      "It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.\n",
      "At 5'5\" (almost), 122lbs., i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no, i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad, i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated, and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . .\n",
      "Well fitting bra, comfortable (not itchy), lace doesn't show through tops.\n",
      "Purchased in the light grey and was so excited, i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!\n",
      "Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion, and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy, but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.\n",
      "Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!\n",

      "I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!\n",
      "This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut, especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans. \r\n",

      "I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this \"cardigan\" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short, i'm only 5 5\" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but\n",

      "Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.\n",

      "This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8\" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.\n",

      "I have the blue and holly joggers. i absolutely love the fit,  feel and color of the joggers. the oddity is that the elastic at the waist bunches in the blue pair but not the holly. it drives me crazy. i could only wear the blue for a couple of hours before i had to change into something else (unfortunately the holly joggers were in the wash).  i'm going to take the blue joggers to the seamstress. maybe she can fix them. 65\", 135, small was perfect.\n",
      "I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.\n",
      "I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top, but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves, but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick, which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up, but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.\n",

      "Extremely comfortable t. fits tts. bought in black & teal. can be dressed up with a scarf or worn with just jewelry. fairly lightweight so probably not a good choice for cold winter months. great price too!\n",
      "I wanted to love it - the color is great, the embroidery pretty, but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.\n",
      "These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!\n",
      "Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!\n",
      "Excellent tunic tee. will be great with leggings or jeans, which is just what i was hoping.\n",
      "I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me, but i'm between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!\n",
      "So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress\n",

      "The fit and feel of this top is lovely. great shirt to layer. fits great, i get compliments every time i wear it.\n",
      "Beautiful detail, soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7\" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length.\n",
      "I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.\n",
      "Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as \"batwings.\" that should have been depicted in one of the photos.\n",
      "I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.\n",

      "Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me, although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.\n",
      "I love these shirts. ordered in 2 colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves. so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long!! the fabric is fabulous and a great weight. one of my favorites for sure.\n",
      "After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.\n",
      "I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8\", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit\n",
      "This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave, or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau\n",

      "Like the previous reviewer stated, it's more like a cape. i'd to call it a cape-digan. style: super comfy, loose fit for comfort. fabric: high quality, just right thickness (not too thick, not too thin), snuggly soft, doesn't pill with wear. design: totally retailer cute and quirkiness, top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity, and the sleeve has sheep and a fence (how cute is that!). this is a very versatile sweater, goes with everything, and so comfortable that i reach for\n",

      "I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived, i thought it was a cute, different top, uniquely designed. when i tried it on, it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately, it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect\n",
      "I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it's on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9\", 140lbs, and 34d).\n",
      "Love this sweater. bought this with the matching leggings. couldn't be more comfortable. cozy fabric. cute details. loving them both. please bring more of the same in different colors, patterns.\n",
      "I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.\n",
      "So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!\n",
      "I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n\n",
      "I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i wasn't crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i don't really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale.\n",
      "I love the versatility of this top. i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down.\n",
      "I am usually a 32a. i ended up with a 34 b based on sales assoc input and what was available. the 32 gave me back fat ( i do not have back fat) so she said the 34 would be better, it ran small etc. the 34 also fit ( had to be ordered and mailed) but it still gave me \"flab\" over the back band. comparing it to my other regular bras, i can see that the band has too thin fabric and rolls and has \"harder edges\" compared to wider , thicker band on my other bras. very pretty but i will be returning. sa\n",
      "Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2\"), though fits like in photos.\n",
      "I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.\n",
      "I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it, it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly!\n",
      "This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!\n",
      "I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3\", i love the length.\n",
      "Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute, it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.\n",
      "This multi-season dress fits beautifully, the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight, drape and swing to it. the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but it's probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer.\n",
      "I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.\n",
      "I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.\n",
      "The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress.\n",
      "Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure, and this just made me look like i was pregnant.\n",
      "I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is \"the perfect fit\" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.\n",
      "I love this dress, although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person, it's a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesn't feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however, the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it's a bit strange looking.\n",
      "Looks great with skinny jeans, leggings, trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.\n",
      "This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an\n",
      "This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.\n",
      "Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.\n",
      "Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.\n",
      "What a pleasant surprise! hugs in all the right places and a nice substantial material!\n",
      "I am 5'8\", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!\n",
      "I purchased this dress off the reviews.unfortunately i have to return it. i expected it to fit as they said. i am 5'1'- 120 lbs. 35/b-c. i got the s petite. i could not even get this dress on over my chest. the waist was on top of my chest. \r\n",
      "i really was disappointed . the material is so soft, i would have had to purchase a m in a regular to fit me. and it would have looked terrible on me. so, i would say, for a tall thin girl , yes , a short girl a no. and i am very petite.\n",
      "This dress has become a favorite in my rotation. the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist. the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories.\n",
      "Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!\n",
      "I am 5'3\" 130lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly. the dress hugs my figure nicely. \r\n",
      "unfortunately, i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work, at least for my own comfort level, but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date. i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress.\n",
      "Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!\n",
      "I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10\", and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model, and the cut was just too wide under the armpits.\n",
      "Loved the fit of these jeans and the fading but the ripping was too much for me at my age. i normally wear petite but since these are mid rise ankle just ordered in 27 regular. so the ripping was right at my knee and did not like that.\n",
      "Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)\n",
      "I ordered my usual xs petite, and it fit like a glove (115lbs, 5'1.5\"). the v cut a little low, making this dress almost too sexy for work. cut is extremely flattering, and the coloring being so neutral is a step away from basic lbd. the length was pefect. material is stretchy, amking this slim fit comfortable.\n",
      "This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back.\n",
      "Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!\n",
      "I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.\n",
      "I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.\n",
      "Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.\n",
      "This is a great sweater/poncho. is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath. great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans.\n",
      "I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.\n",
      "I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/4 from bottom of collar (the collar adds 1 1/4\") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front.\n",
      "Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many \"bandage\" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7\" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.\n",
      "First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin\n",
      "The top fits nice, but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.\n",
      "Tried the xs on in store from an online return, loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned, it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned, the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.\n",
      "Okay, i love the blouse this brand has in the same material, so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7\" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this, usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist, and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose, and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my\n",
      "Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so\n",
      "I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!\n",
      "I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits, but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it, but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit, i will be returning this dress.\n",
      "This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed, except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5\", 122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else, but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also, it is quite low cut, so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason\n",
      "I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality. (after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment.) i couldn't be more thrilled with this choice! it is so flattering on, beautiful color and cut. the only complaint i have is slightly minor, and it's in relation to the hidden bac\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the color \"black motif\"although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the \"blue motif\" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease, modern look, and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years), but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this \"easy\" skirt, and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi\n",
      "If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.\n",
      "I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3\" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.\n",
      "First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.\n",
      "Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!\n",
      "I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.\n",
      "Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock,under my arm, which could be seen, i guess, if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next, who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top, i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b\n",
      "This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!\r\n",
      "i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!\r\n",
      "i wish they had other colors!!!!!!\n",
      "Love this vest- it's so chic and pairs with so much.  i have it in the army green and it's prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top.   it's great.   i am about 5'2\" and an typically a small top-  the small was much to big but the xs was perfect. i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain. i am very happy with my purchase!\n",
      "Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.\n",
      "These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these!\n",
      "I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it's not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!\n",
      "I love this vest, bought it in green and want to order white. its very flattering, and i wore it with a black tank top, ripped faded stevie cropped jeans, and gold gladiators. i would like to mention the care. i dripped something on the lapel, so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel. it made a lighter mark, so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine. i hung it to dry, and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up. it lightened up a\n",
      "I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous, the fabric feels a bit weird, kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length, and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!\n",
      "Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!\n",
      "I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3\" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the\n",
      "I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.\n",

      "the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &\n",
      "Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.\n",
      "I am 5'2\" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.\n",
      "But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)\n",
      "I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.\r\n",

      "i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo\n",
      "These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.\n",
      "I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my \"wheelhouse\" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't \"pull it off,\" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7\" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took\n",

      "I have the white lemon lace shirt and love it so i was excited to see it in a color well suited for fall. the peacock pattern on the blouse i received is perfect and the pattern is well placed. i do love this one as much as the lemon blouse, however, the color is not the same as it appears online. it is more of a jade green color, and although it's pretty, i would have preferred it to look more of a blue color. i'm keeping it, as it is still an unusual and elegant blouse that's cute with dark sk\n",
      "I love this so so much. i'm 5'1\" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch, height, and leg area. so excited to wear this!\n",
      "The colors in the green shirt are beautiful, however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6\" 120#, not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall, wispy , less curves...\n",
      "I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.\n",
      "I don't if it is me, but usually i am a solid size 6, occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light, and while it is a weird texture, it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.\n",
      "I bought this in green and i absolutely love it! the quality of material is very fantastic, a durable fabric that will hold up well over time. its a good quality too, so can be dressed up somewhat, and also does well as a very casual piece. love it!\n",
      "Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.\n",
      "Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!\n",

      "The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2\", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.\n",
      "Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.\n",
      "I bought these in the blue. i sized down, as other reviewers mentioned, going for an xs. i'm 5'5\" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5\" the length was too long for me, hitting me below my ankles, rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then, i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly, they hung a little funny on me, rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price, these went back!\n",
      "This is a gorgeous high quality blouse. the color is stunning in person; i don't have anything like this color in my wardrobe. i'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this blouse in a 16. i am busty but the top still fit well. i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine; i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesn't apply to most people. if you're very thin and not busty you might be able to size down, but i'm honestly just not sure. i'm happy to say\n",

      "This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase, i have bought another pair. it seems that they are just a great fit for my body, long and lean, but not extreme. someone said they run large, but my experience is true to size. these pants can be very casual around the house, out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out. i love that the elastic waist isn't bunchee. they hang very straight and pretty, just like in this picture. the fabric has some text\n",
      "I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great, the fit was great, but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.\n",
      "Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash, so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist, slim hips, flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.\n",

      "I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st\n",

      "Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.\n",

      "This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would\n",

      "When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that\n",
      "This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up, but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable, warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size, i ordered a small (5'5\" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!\n",
      "I have to say being a silk lover, decision was hard to make. the quality is phenomenal. i do agree to a reviewer that said it's pj like. i tried it with belt, didn't help much with the look somehow. it just felt empty. my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said \"ewww, grandma\"... i know, truth hurts.\r\n",

      "This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!\n",
      "This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9\". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it.\n",
      "I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute, but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.\n",
      "The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7\" 135 the dress was long enough, just didn't flow very well.\n",

      "Cute, cool dress for hot summer days. very roomy. has pockets!\n",
      "I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.\n",

      "I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments), while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful, i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it, it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7\", 135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially, but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still\n",

      "This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one\n",

      "This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li\n",

      "I wore this dress to nyc on a date. it was perfect...light, flowy, and lovely. the peach and green combination is really pretty, and i love the hemline, which is longer in the back than in the front. i can only say one thing: as i was walking down the street with my boyfriend, a total stranger (and not a crazy person) came up to us and told us we looked beautiful. enough said.\n",
      "I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately (the green motif). as others noted, it is on the flowly side. for this reason, i went with a size s. i wore it on easter and can't wait to wear it again. i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress. it is a simple over the head, no fuss kind of dress. you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess. this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years\n",

      "I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!\n",
      "This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath, and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out, and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned, the quality could be slightly better, but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.\n",
      "What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.\n",
      "I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful, i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like\n",
      "I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a\n",
      "I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.\n",
      "I cannot give this dress enough praise!! i say it runs a little large because i'm normally an 8 but the 6 was just more flattering.  i wore it for a wedding and i was showered with compliment after compliment about the dress! i've never felt more beautiful, and wish i could have one in every color! and quality? absolutely amazing.\n",
      "Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small, (120, 5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.\n",
      "I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.\n",
      "Love the unique look of this coat. living in the northeast, during cold weather i wanted something warm that wasn't your run-of-the-mill wool coat. i agree with the other reviews about the somewhat \"bulky\" nature of the coat, but i'm not wearing a coat of this nature to look thin. i'm fairly thin, 5'4\" 102, i know i'm not bulky, so i didn't care if the coat made me \"look heavier\" than i am, it's a winter coat, get over yourself, no one really cares how much you weigh. so, if you can get past tha\n",
      "More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it, on the front, the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material. not a travel top as it would wrinkle. the pattern and colors are the same as pictured. the sizing is large - i ordered an xs; my size is usually a small. it is a generous fit and boxy, not shaped at all. the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effect.the back (which is all black and is tee shirt fabric)\n",
      "On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.\n",

      "Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red, oh la la! style is feminine, elegant, and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked, i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug, nothing uncomfortable, just snug. length is below kne\n",

      "I got this top in the beige, size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it, they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.\n",
      "Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.\n",
      "I bought this dress with a specific occasion in mind. i could not turn it down because it fit like a glove. i love the cut and the length.\n",
      "Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!\n",
      "I bought this in the blue stripe and the color is not what is shown at all! the photo shows a bright, vibrant blue and white stripe top. i got a white and very light pastel blue stripe top. so disappointed because the top doesn't have that wow look as shown in the photo. however, it goes well with blue jeans even in the lighter shade of blue.\r\n",

      "I love the sparkled fabric and intricate design on the back. i had trouble with the front because the cowl exposed a bit too much, so i wore a tank top underneath. ordering a petite may have helped with the cowl.\n",
      "The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,\n",
      "I didn't mind the \"scratchiness\" others proclaimed this garment had, but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front, but uncomfortable.\n",
      "Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9\" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4\" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!\n",
      "I knew i had to have this shirt when i saw it online. the embroidery is almost like english smocking. i was not disappointed when i opened my package. the only flaw i've noticed is that it does \"pucker\" slightly around the shoulders and chest area due to the tight embroidery not allowing it to stretch. it is not terribly noticeable though. lovely shirt all around.\n",
      "Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip\n",
      "It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin\n",
      "This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft, comfortably loose, but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!\n",
      "This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.\n",
      "There are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right now-this is not one of my favorites. while the color is amazing, the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way. the are very close together which is hard to button up. the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hour-glass shape. however, sizing down (which would also fix this problem) would cause the shoulder/arm area to be too tight.\n",
      "I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.\n",
      "Full disclosure, i'm six months pregnant. as such, this dress is perfect for me. it's soft and flown, and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like i'm wearing a sack. i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews, and t fits perfectly--so it would have been too big normally.\n",
      "I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing, when i tied the strap, the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on, it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.\n",
      "This is a great coat, very lightweight, but warm. the color is gorgeous. it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length. i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing. by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted. i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium (if i want to wear much underneath it). as it is it fits too well, like a dress, not a coat and looks short waisted. in fact, when i tr\n",

      "I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.\n",
      "I bought the \"light grey\" color. the dress in the photo does not look a thing like the dress in person, it does not look grey at all but more of a light teal/light blue.  it is absolutely gorgeous and has a slight swing shape. i took my normal size xs.  the end of the sleeves (where the buttons are) are very tight but still fit, you just have to be careful taking off or else undo the buttons.  also online inventory says no one has this in store, but i did end up finding it (rockefeller).\n",

      "On the hanger, this looks like a great lbd. on me, not quite. the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle.  for reference, i tried a 0p, and i'm 5,1\", 102#, and 34a.\n",
      "The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.\n",
      "I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back, in the main photo, to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!\n",
      "This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights, etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you, buy it!\n",
      "I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'5 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!\n",
      "It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous, however, ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi\n",
      "I was really hoping this dress would work out, as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice, but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure, but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.\n",
      "I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9\", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well.\n",

      "First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.\n",
      "This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, 2 buttons popped off!\n",
      "It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough, there is a slip underneath.\n",

      "While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.\n",
      "The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.\n",
      "Classic and beautiful style. structured material that will always fall just right. looks beautiful and will take you to any occasion - heels or flats, office or dinner party. definitely shows off your shoulders.\n",
      "I had the priviledge of trying this on during the 20% off tops sale, too bad but the store only had regualr sizes, and xs was the smallest. i am not super tiny (read have muscles), but this looked huge on me. love the colros and textures though, the line in the back is pretty and adds charm when you turn around, and the combo of all the colros is awesome, but i would need a xxs or perhaps a petite (though it is short, so not sure about petite)... soft, but try a smaller size...\n",
      "Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders, it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short, i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there, she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby,\n",
      "These are absolutely fabulous!!! love them! comfortable great fabric! best buy of the year so far!\n",
      "When i saw this in store i was so attracted to the colors on the v neck and actually thought it was a dress! until i tried it on i was confused about the very high side slits.... then i figured it was a tunic. i've always hated/avoided tunics because i thought they would widen my thighs and give me a bad shape. they actually made me look straighter/slimmer which looked amazing! the more i had it on, the more i fell in love with it and didn't want to take it off! i can wear it in the winter and f\n",
      "I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.\n",
      "I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.\n",
      "First, let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1\", 138lbs, 34dd, 30, 38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve, esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the bad: surprisingly, the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f\n",
      "I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying\n",
      "Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.\n",
      "The design/pattern balances broader shoulders/narrower hips and gives my straighter waist definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "at 5'1\", size 2 ended mid-knee, but overall felt a little too long (torso length). i normally take 0p or 00p in retailer dresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "i like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look.\n",
      "This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small, but it was still gigantic.\n",
      "I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5\", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic \"flaps\" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on\n",
      "The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest, it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model, so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!\n",
      "Very chic version of a turtleneck/tunic. material more substantial than i expected. ultimately it wasn't really flattering on my body type but otherwise i would absolutely recommend.\n",
      "This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft), the flowers, the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!\n",
      "I have never written a review on retailer before, but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online, i felt i had a duty to review it. it is gorgeous! i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it. the fabric is light pink with a shimmer. the flower detailing is so feminine and soft. the back's closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing. i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be\n",
      "\n",
      "This dress fits true to sizing for this dress designer (i.e.: a little on the large side as compared to other dressmakers). it is very flattering on and is made of cotton sailcloth, so it is not \"flowy\".\n",
      "I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!\n",
      "This is a very cute tunic, but it is slit so high on the sides. i really like the fit, but i think i'm going to return it because it is slit so high.\n",
      "Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26\" (so it is at least 2\" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!\n",
      "This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1\" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!\n",
      "This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.\n",
      "I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available, so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white, like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress, but t\n",
      "I absolutely love these pants! i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper. i've always liked the look of these pants but didn't think i had the body type to pull them off being 5'5\" with some curves. i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small. i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips. the draping isn't as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didn't add weight to my frame. the mate\n",
      "Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i\"m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out.\n",
      "First off, the pictures online hardly do these justice. these pants are way cool. they are soft, have the perfect little pattern, they have a great tie detail on the cuff, they are higher waist (which is always more comfy), and they are super stylish! just like the other reviewer, i am occasionally hesitant on drop crotch pants...but i was so drawn to these. i'm glad i have them a shot because they are way better than i expected! these are worth the buy!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very chic tunic sweater. i absolutely love it. fabric is super soft and is a good weight. not too thick or heavy, which for me is a huge plus as i tend to run hot and usually can't wear sweaters. being hot natured, the turtleneck was a problem for me so i had my tailor alter it. it is still beautiful without the high neck. \r\n",
      "the fabric is quite stretchy and i found it to be tts. however, it is not as loose on me through the chest as it is on the model. i am just over 5'4\", and wear an\n",
      "I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.\n",
      "This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however, i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide, better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.\n",
      "\n",
      "i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled!\n",
      "sadly returning.\n",
      "I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)\n",
      "I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o\n",
      "These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic, but ultimately decided to return.\n",
      "I usually wear a small, 4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.\n",
      "I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.\n",
      "Oh my, i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 25 waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5\" and the length is good too, not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class, sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!\n",
      "I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8\", hourglass, 135 lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!\n",
      "I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.\n",
      "I am 5'8\" 140 lbs., 34b, and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but wasn't at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews, i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however, i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half, thereby making me look larger than i am, so i sent it back. otherwise, this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein\n",
      "Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, it's flattering for us curvier ladies,\n",
      "I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. i'm between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six, but it's definitely tight. i have a larger chest, and it's pretty low and sexy, though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. i've also put shirts under it and it's a super cute jumper. i'm 5'1 and the dress (regular, not petite) hits right below my knee.\n",
      "I?ve been looking at this dress online for some time now, but i?ve been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat. it just did not seem right. but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it. it is a wonderfully soft, linen dress. it is a bit tight in the midriff, so i had to size up a bit. i usually wear a size 2, but went with size 4 this time. size 4 fit perfectly. it is comfortable, easy to wear, just the right amount of sexy. it will be a nice every day dress for summer i\n",
      "Love this dress. i have it in white. just washed it in cold water in the machine and it still looks like new. very cute and comfortable. i stitched up the slit a bit, i am older, but otherwise, perfect.\n",
      "I absolutely adore this dress! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress. it's effortless, yet still a showstopper. i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me. it's not too tight in the ribcage, yet it is slimming and flattering. not matronly at all! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look, or worn untied for a breezy, casual, a bit more sexy look. i will be wearing this dress\n",
      "Yes! yes! yes! \r\n",
      "i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because, 1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is, and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i don't know how this designer did it, but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger\n",
      "This jacket fits just a tad big, but it's quite comfortable. it's the perfect touch to dress up jeans! i've gotten lots of compliments.\n",
      "I saw this dress online and loved it. i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an 8 and 10, but i think the 10 was sized wrong. anyhow, both were too small, so when i returned them, they were in the store! i ended up with a size 12 which fits great, with a little bit of room. it is light weight, simple but fun and very comfortable to wear. i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it. i also ordered it in white, thinking that i might prefer that color, but when it arri\n",
      "I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model, but when i received it, it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3, 123 lbs., 34-d. it's going back.\n",
      "I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t\n",
      "The double seams down the front of this elongate; the material is light and would work spring through summer, kind shape. even though the dress hits below the knee, the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly. here's the but:\r\n",
      "the rib cage area is very fitted. i'm a 6-8, in pretty good shape, and that is not a \"problem area\" for me. however, in this dress, it was. there was no way for my figure to pull it off. from behind, in both 6 and 8, every bundle of skin seemed ample. i\n",
      "I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it, around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering, but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is, even with the tag sale. the color, pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one, but, as i sa\n",
      "I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6, but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8\", small busted, and a \"pear\" shape, so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point.\n",
      "Its a beautiful print and design. the shirt overall is a little short but untucked it can work. i dont know why everybody is making these short square little tops. overall, i am intrigued with the whimsical print and i like that enough to overlook the length.\n",
      "This is a stunning blouse! you can't tell from the photo, but it looks very 1930-1940's. i am so happy with this blouse, it is gorgeous. i'm an xl, and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully. it fits nice and flowy and i feel i don't need a cam underneath. i highly recommend it!\n",
      "I ordered the white \"denim\" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!\n",
      "Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand, elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring\n",
      "This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states, petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4, 120, 32d and i ordered a petite size 4 and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!\n",
      "This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing! i ordered the size small and it fits as expected. i normally wear a size small and a size 4.\n",
      "A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small. it's cute & flowy & like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings. have worn with shorts as well. casual & cute! plus i love cotton anyways. 5'3\", 117#. think i'll go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon....\n",
      "This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for reference, i am a 34a, and purchased a small.\n",
      "I did not experience the issues the other reviewers mentioned. wore this to a wedding last month and received many compliments. beautiful, comfortable dress. the bust fit well -- slightly large on me (i am *just* a b) in the size i needed, but not horribly so. love this dress!\n",
      "This dress is very feminine and flattering on, especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). when it's very fitted on top, i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2\"). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman, but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is\n",
      "This dress makes me looks curvy,thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5\" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!\n",
      "I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.\n",
      "These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.\n",
      "I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.\n",
      "Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.\n",
      "The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... \r\n",
      "however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.\n",
      "This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.\n",
      "This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.\n",
      "This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me, but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.\r\n",
      "if they had additional colors, i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.\n",
      "Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i'm a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up.\n",
      "I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts, half tucked, and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering, it is a tiny bit sheer, but i was wearing a magenta bra, so perhaps i am biased. overall, i think this is a good basic addition, to a summer wardrobe, can be worn with a nice skirt, or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs, can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs, with 30dd chest.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a \"crop top\"\n",
      "Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.\n",
      "This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors, drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.\n",
      "I purchased this gaucho as a gift for my mother.\r\n",
      "at first, i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.\r\n",
      "but later, it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.\r\n",
      "it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.\r\n",
      "it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.\r\n",
      "however, i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashion.\r\n",
      "so, if you happen to save those \"good old fashion\", take them out and try\n",
      "Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.\n",
      "More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it's very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.\n",
      "With the pleats, probably need to tuck in shirt. these were too big for me, so need to return.\n",
      "Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.\n",
      "When this dress first showed up online, i liked it, but didn't buy it because i wasn't in love. retailer weekend popped up, so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first \"off the shoulder\" dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up, no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy.\n",
      "This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3\" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!\n",
      "I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.\n",
      "Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!\n",
      "This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it's very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.\n",
      "I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.\n",
      "Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.\n",
      "This dress is so versatile. great summer wear!\n",
      "Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.\n",
      "I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7\") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding\n",
      "I bought these pants in yellow for an event where i had to wear yellow. i was weary about the color but it is so great in person. it's a very bright lemon-y yellow. they're high waisted and very flattering. i'm 5'11\" and normally wear a 30 and they were a little too large but nothing a tight belt couldn't fix. they also hit a little bit above the ankle which initially i was worried about with the flare but it actually was a really cool look. i received so many compliments that day and am glad to\n",
      "Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!\n",
      "Love the bright colors! made really well!! super soft and vibrant!\n",
      "This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.\n",
      "I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!\n",
      "I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.\n",
      "Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i do wish they came in more colors.\n",
      "Love this sweater! it feels so soft and it slides right on over the head and neck. easy to wear. this is my favorite sweater. i wear it all the time. the lilac is a really nice subtle color as well. meant to be roomy.\n",
      "I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.\n",
      "I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack, in a moss green color. the material, cut, and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26, and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items, they cost $42 + tax.\n",
      "I got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe, and i was not disappointed. the pants are well-designed and drape well. unlike a previous reviewer, i did not find the fabric to be cheap, but it is light and a little blousy--not bad for a warm region like mine. this polyester fabric has two advantages: no fading and no wrinkles. a good staple for work.\n",
      "Was worried these pants would make my 5'2\" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future.\n",
      "I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i\n",
      "Tried them on in store. they were actually kind of sexy on. i have an hourglass figure and the way that these fit, felt sort of like a 50's/60's fit, accentuating and flattering my shape. \r\n",
      "on my to get list.\n",
      "I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9\" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front, which i don't like, as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen, they will require frequent ironing (which, i hate to do in the summer).\n",
      "I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.\n",
      "I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.\n",
      "Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.\n",
      "I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.\n",
      "I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.\n",
      "The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!\n",
      "I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the \"red\" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!\n",
      "Way too big and unflattering. i would love it to look like it does online but it's huge in person.\n",
      "I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul\n",
      "These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my \"hyphen\" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.\n",
      "This dress set my heart a-flutter, but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes, and when i put them on, they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).\n",
      "\n",
      "so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v\n",
      "This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.\n",
      "I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2\" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash, and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans.\n",
      "I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8\" frame. wish it came in a tall size!\n",
      "I tried these shorts on in 5 colors and found a wide variety of sizing. in the dark grey and taupe i needed to size down one from my usual 28 to a size 27. in the sapphire, lavender and red my regular size 28 fit perfectly. i ended up purchasing the dark grey and lavender with a discount. i gave 4 stars for the variation in sizing but once i got the correct fit the shorts have not stretched out on me throughout the day in either color. the length is perfect, short enough to not look frumpy, but\n",
      "I never buy shorter shorts, my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering, but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model, but hit a nice spot on the leg, and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs, all legs...\n",
      "I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back\n",
      "Perfect top! i love the mix of materials, silky in the front and comfy knit in the back. the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt. happy!\n",
      "I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.\n",
      "These shorts are age-appropriate for all. they're loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee. the fabric is soft and colors are fun\n",
      "Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!\n",
      "I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.\n",
      "This coat is super cute and flattering. i am 5&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;8&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; and it comes almost to my knee on the back. i&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;m usually a small but got the medium in case i wear a bulky sweater underneath. comfy and warm, but won&amp;amp;amp;#39;t be warm enough when winter hits without a big sweater underneath. great to throw on to walk the dog or hit the bus stop in style.\n",
      "These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!\n",
      "I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i normally wear an 18, sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths, but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12, so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "this dress fits in\n",
      "Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.\n",
      "These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since it's not \"hemmed\" to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!\n",
      "I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants.\n",
      "I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me, but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25,26, or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately, there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....\n",
      "I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors, so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise, nice shorts for the price.\n",
      "This pants the worst short that i ever had!!\r\n",
      "i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!\r\n",
      "i was really shock definetly will return it to store.\r\n",
      "fyi, i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.\n",
      "Great shorts. i've been buying these for the past few years. each year, i add to my collection with new colors. i have 8 pairs now! perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg.\n",
      "So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom\n",
      "I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.\n",
      "I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home\n",
      "I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.\r\n",
      "i don't usually go for peplum, but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on, everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.\n",
      "I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????\n",
      "I have been eyeing this top online and initially thought it was very fitted and structured as it appears on the model. upon trying it on at the store, i agree with other reviewers it is a tad boxy. i ended up sizing down to a small and it fits nicely. (5' 8\", 145, usually i take a medium or 6/8 in retailer tops). i can see where this might not work for everyone, but i found it to be a fun take on a classic \"tweedy\" look. i plan to add a pop of color with jewelry or even pair it with the pin\n",
      "This dress is lovely and the fabric is sensational.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the slits on the two sides of center front are really cool too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i am 5'7 and it was way too long and i would not have it hemmed at it would remove the gorgeous\r\n",
      "lotus pattern near the base of the skirt. i only wear flats at 70 but hope this fabric appears somewhere else\r\n",
      "sometime. it is truly a gorgeous dress for a taller person.\n",
      "I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.\n",
      "I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great, if the fit works for you.\n",
      "First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4\" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about\n",
      "The quality of this top is quite high. it feels like silk. the print is lovely, showy without being too over the top. i love it and would highly recommend it.\n",
      "This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.\n",
      "I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!\n",
      "These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly, using free and clear detergent on a cold, delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy, and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair, but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go, but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!\n",
      "I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too.\n",
      "Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l, 5'8\" 175lbs, am busty. very nice fabric, prone to wrinkles.\n",
      "These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .\n",
      "I really love this coat! it is beautiful and very comfortable. while the attached scarf does cover the cute buttons, i'm glad it is there! it comes in handy when the temperature drops quicker than anticipated. the only thing missing on this coat is a lining as soft as the exterior.\n",
      "I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.\n",
      "Wonderful flattering fit, mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection. i bought 3 pair. thrilled with pilcro. \r\n",
      "only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa.  cuffs roll down if you want less sun.\n",
      "No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.\n",
      "I like this top. i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work, but the material doesn't feel as high-quality as i had expected from the pictures online. it wasn't worth it to me to send it back, but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first.\n",
      "I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year, these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!\n",
      "This shirt is amazing. the pictures on the model do not do the shirt justice! the shirt is a bit longer in person than shown on the model. the colors are also more vibrant. the material is so soft and has great flow. i am excited to dress it up for work with a pencil skirt and have the option to wear with skinnies and a cute sandal on my off days.\n",
      "If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.\n",
      "I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear\n",
      "These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.\n",
      "A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.\n",
      "Another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill. usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size. i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me. very happy with the color, quality and uniqueness of the dress!\n",
      "I'm 5 ' 5\" and 132 lbs., 34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin, long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned, it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual, very versatile, perfect for a hot day summer dress!\n",
      "This is my second pair of these jeans (i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement). wear them all the time. i did go up one size to get a better fit (i don't exactly have slim thighs--ha!), but other than that, they are pretty perfect!\n",
      "I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them\n",
      "This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.\n",
      "Been searching for a denim \"trucker\" jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock, purchased it online without thinking twice. typically, due to my small upper frame, i'm 5'4, 130lbs, 34 a for referance, i'm between a size small and an xs. bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived. \r\n",
      "i love the fit, slightly cropped in the back and i also like how it\"s lined inside. great quality and perfect for fall!\n",
      "Really like this top. colors are great for summer into fall and beyond. can be worn on or off shoulder. it is longer, but not tunic length. covers your bum. i haven't loved a couple of other off shoulder tops i got at retailer, but this one i do. the fabric isn't \"puffy\" so i don't balloon out under the bust. i am 5'6\" 123lbs and 32d. got the small because i wanted length. would have even got the medium but the neckline was too wide.\n",
      "I've received so many compliments. it's comfy and cute looking. the sleeves are a little short--which i wasn't expecting, but i love it nonetheless. just putting that out there in case you couldn't tell from the picture. i ordered an xs\n",
      "This is the perfect dress to transition into fall, either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand, ranna gill, but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price, i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.\n",
      "I ordered this with another sweater to compare the two, hoping that one would be what i was looking for. the stitching on this sweater is beautiful so i honestly expected to keep this one. i was looking for a cardigan that was on the longer side as i wear leggings often. this cardigan was not as long as it seems in the picture (hit at my hips, 5'10\" tall). the material seems stiff and a bit rough. the sizing is a bit boxy because it is wide/big cardigan but also short. the stitching was just as\n",
      "Yes, this is a beautiful print and fits perfectly...but it's unlined thin polyester. full price is pretty ludicrous on this one. tts, but might need to size up if you have a larger chest (no stretch). hoping to grab on sale.\n",
      "Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?\n",
      "I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison. i chose this one over the levi's jacket as this one had more shape/curve to the bodice, which i wanted. i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket-- i have wider shoulders, 34c chest, 28\" waist, 38\" hip, 5' 4\" 120lbs.\n",
      "Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.\n",
      "Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!\n",
      "Bought this dress for my boho bridal shower and loved it! it was perfect for the season and fit like a charm. i normally wear a 4-6 and needed the 2 so heads up that they run a little big.\n",
      "I haven't owned a denim jacket since college, but i felt inspired this season. this pilcro jacket is perfect. a little distressed along the edges, tailored fit, and i love the cozy collar. looks expensive. fits really well.\n",
      "This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons! the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely!\n",
      "I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring\n",
      "I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i won't buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.\n",
      "The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model, and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because, mainly, it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it, i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly, if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a\n",
      "This top caught my eye right away and i had to have it! i am obsessed with everything off the shoulder and this is a great transition piece to wear that off the shoulder look well into fall. i was expecting the fabric to be a little lighter and i did't realize there would be a ribbed texture to the fabric. the shirt is also very long and i feel as though it runs large. that being said it looks super cute on and i intend to style it just as shown in these pictures with zipper accented skinny jean\n",
      "Cute off-the-shoulder top with a dark floral motif totally on trend for fall. as previous reviews mentioned, material is ribbed, which makes it look a bit like corduroy. but, it is not thick so it just makes it seem more appropriate for colder weather. i think it will be great with skinny jeans and a choker.\n",
      "This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.\n",
      "Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4\" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.\n",
      "I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large, i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will, though.\n",
      "I absolutely love the color, cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress\n",
      "I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things, and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back! i tend to wear medium shirts and large jackets/coats to fit my long arms, and the sleeves are a great length for me. the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too. the buttons were difficult to button at first, but became easier over time as the fabric softened. i also bought a pilcro skirt and it's comfortable too, so overall i&#39;m very happy with this brand.\n",
      "I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!\n",
      "I love these jeans ~ the are so soft, so comfortable, nice fabric weight...not too heavy or stiff at all, very flattering, best of all they move with you, but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day ~ i am on retailer site now to purchase another color~\n",
      "I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy, but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress, yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through, however, for a texas summer, that defeats the point of a loose, easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.\n",
      "Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!\n",
      "I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3\" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!\n",
      "Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.\n",
      "I usually have to order a size up in ranna gill dresses because of tight bodices. i did this time and it's too big, so i would stay tts or size down depending on your bust size. color is more moss/olive (green with a gray undertone) than shown online. no liner and the fabric is a smooth polyester that feels more summer weight than autumn. gorgeous embroidery on the chest. teeny tiny neck button closure and fussy side zip. i am 5'3\" and purchased petite but it is still too long unless i wear my f\n",
      "I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.\n",
      "Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on, i loved it. colors are muted, and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy, which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8\"). it does look great off the shoulders, but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large, but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to\n",
      "This dress was almost perfect, but the white was just a bit too sheer to be worn without a slip. i wear a lot of cloth and stone pieces, and i generally like the fabrication, which is a bit thicker than some. in a top, the white of cloth and stone is sheer without being vulgar. however, translated to a dress it becomes a bit too sheer in certain areas. even with a nude bra and underwear, i could see everything. it might make a good bathing suit coverup, though.\r\n",
      "the fit is tts: 36c, broad should\n",
      "I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :)\n",
      "This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes, it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!\n",
      "I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.\n",
      "I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.\n",
      "I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7\"). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais\n",
      "This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.\n",
      "Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note, the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time, hence the back up.\n",
      "So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.\n",
      "This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have \r\n",
      "a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material\r\n",
      " like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.\n",
      "the front pocket is different, but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before\n",
      "What an adorable print!  yes, it may be a bit juvenile for someone my age but i don't care.  the toucans are rendered in soft primary colors.  the skirt is swingy but not poufy.  whole dress is lined so thankfully it's not a see through white fabric.  the bodice in medium petite fits me just perfectly (36dd) so if you are slender on top, size down.  agree with the previous reviewer about the zipper, which i find to be cheap and irritating, especially when zipping over the waistband.  worried abo\n",
      "I really love this tee! but, the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.\n",
      "This top is so soft, simple, and such a closet staple, if you get the right size! for reference, i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color, hard to describe, kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!\n",
      "The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line, though the description indicates \"green multi\"--it is not green. i returned the item, however. the quality is fine, but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.\n",
      "I bought this shirt for my 16 year old daughter. it looked adorable on her! she loved it and can't wait to wear it. the fabric felt like a great quality and the color was quite unique.\n",
      "This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size, and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life, it's more like distressed charcoal gray), and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual, and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer, being long in the torso. even going down a size, the length is great. overall, i like that t\n",
      "This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!\n",
      "Love love love this dress! quality and fabric are terrific, design is a little 50s throwback! fits well and flatters the body!\n",
      "This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down\n",
      "This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.\n",
      "The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.\n",
      "I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped \"skirted\" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5\" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it\n",
      "I wanted to like this top, as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store, i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2\", 110 lbs), and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality, but unfortunately in this design, that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.\n",
      "I found this today on the one and only rack. i absolutely fell in love with it. i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly. other customers were asking where they could find it in the store. i highly recommend. it can be dressed up or down.\n",
      "I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.\n",
      "I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.\n",
      "This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty\n",
      "This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.\n",
      "This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :)\n",
      "This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver\n",
      "This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.\r\n",
      "i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.\n",
      "This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies. i purchased the gray colorway. i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews. the xs is still pretty loose on me, but i don't mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway. the color is so pretty and the design is edgy. it will transition to fall well.\n",
      "I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.\n",
      "This dress is crazy flattering and extremely versatile. i wish it came in other colors...i would scoop them all up. great price (plus used by birthday 15% off coupon). the fabric is light weight...but not flimsy. plus it's lined with a satin fabric so the dress won't stick to you. i'm 5\" 113 and i ordered the petite x-small and it is perfect. i can see it with fun sneakers (like the picture) or with some fun jewelry and high wedges for going out. thinking of buying a 2nd one as back up...it's th\n",
      "This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.\n",
      "This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.\n",
      "So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.\n",
      "I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in\n",
      "This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.\n",
      "I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me, the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes\n",
      "I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.\n",
      "This is a beautiful skirt. it is exactly as pictured. the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected. i feel like it does run a bit small. i'm usually an 8 in skirts and dresses and bought a 10. it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now. my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement. anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away. the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well. i do\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!\n",
      "Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!\n",
      "I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller, v neck higher up, and the top portion of the dress more fitted, it would be the perfect tee!\n",
      "If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.\n",
      "Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a\n",
      "One of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased!  high quality and fits true to size.  i have a large chest, and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette.  i highly recommend, got so many compliments i bought both colors!\n",

      "Such a cute top. does run slightly big, depending on how loose you want it to be. for such a simple design, the quality is great.\n",
      "A perfect little simple style summer dress just throw it on with some trendy sandals and off you go. runs true to size. just wished they would of made it in other colors and prints.\n",
      "I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs, i'd skip this one. however, if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!\n",
      "Love this tee! it's stylish and comfy. i ordered the white and it's a thicker fabric, so i don't have to wear a camisole underneath.  i want to order more colors.  it does slightly big.\n",
      "Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!\n",
      "I bought the top in an x-large because i normally wear a 12/14 and i was swimming in it. i unfortunately returned it but did eventually buy the large. it is a cute fit and a fun tee to have. the fabric is soft but a little excessive on the bottom.\n",
      "I purchased this in the green color, and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.\n",
      "I love this t-shirt, i feel classy, stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted, it is bellowy in the peplum, but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!\n",
      "Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent\n",

      "I really like the dress, the material, the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however, the neckline is a bit to low, and a cami is necessary, at least for me. the material is very sheer, which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy, not so when taking it off!\n",
      "I used my birthday month discount to treat myself to this gorgeous chemise and matching robe in the mauve. the color is prettier in person than on my computer. i bought it in size m, and size m clothes are normally a little big on me. this chemise fits, but there is no extra room or looseness. i am disappointed in the quality of the pieces. i have several beautiful 100% silk undergarments that i bought for myself in the 80s and 90s, and i am comparing this chemise (& robe) to those. this silk us\n",
      "Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said, the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes, i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly, but a 6 would have looked lumpy\n",
      "I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3\" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off,but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go, a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least\n",
      "This dress is not only beautiful, it's so comfortable to wear. it's also very flattering. i love that i can wear the dress with sandals or boots. great buy!\n",
      "Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish\n",
      "Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a\n",

      "Had my doubts and ordered on sale just to try. am amazed how often i have worn this jacket!! goes with a lot of pants and skirts. great buy on sale. am 5' 6 1/2\" 150lbs and medium is perfect..\n",
      "The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.\n",
      "I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package, as the color was darker than on the picture.\r\n",
      "i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design, it isn't for me as the color is too \"winter\".\n",
      "This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!\n",
      "I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package, it was a wrinkled mess,lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful, the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.\n",
      "When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.\n",
      "These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.\n",
      "I love vests and this is a great one, warm and cute!! because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull, but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have!\n",
      "Love everything about this jacket its super soft, thin, and looks great! it's versatile and a great layering piece for someone that lives in a very warm climate! prefer the sleeves to be worn rolled up and the inside belt definitely helps give the piece more shape and dimension!\n",
      "This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!\n",
      "I love this thing. i bought it yesterday and already am wearing it today, and i have been known to leave things sitting around in my closet for awhile before i wear them, especially if they aren't a sure thing. for reference, i am a curvy, busty size 14. i bought an xl but a l would have worked too. it has a drawstring on the inside back and on the bottom center back hem, so it can be adjusted for more shape through the waist. it has a beautiful drape, is very soft, and the embroidery makes it s\n",
      "I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of \"show it,\" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.\n",
      "I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5\"10, 155lbs. i sent it back.\n",
      "Love the fabric and the casual way this jacket drapes. the color is nice, i bought the blue. usually wear petite sizes but they were sold out so bought the misses in medium and it works perfect. like i can layer it for summer/fall since its very light weight fabric.\n",
      "This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.\n",

      "Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.\n",
      "I purchased an xl and am 5'8\"tall. the pants fall near the ankle just like the pic. i plan to wash on my gentle washing machine cycle. the texture fabric print will pair well with any printed tops you choose. these lounge pants are great for everyday wear especially for errands in town. so much better a choice than yoga pants which to me look ridiculous when wore in public. so ladies, please leave your yoga pants for the gym and treat yourself to these casual, comfortable pants. i have two pairs\n",

      "If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat, i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful, fits like a glove. i got the size 4, went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2, so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful.\n",
      "This is a super cute t-shirt!  it runs a little big and not as long as some t-shirts which is good.   it hits mid-hip on me and i'm 5'7\".    i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too.   warning:  the black one is actually a brownish-black which i didn't like so back it goes.\n",
      "I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(\n",
      "Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.\n",
      "When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on\n",
      "Got this in medium (5'6', 36c, 120 lbs.). many of retailer tops i'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white. not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through. i'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly. a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer. you can wear this dressed up with heels, stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals. looks great with rolled\n",
      "I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so, fresh out of the package, the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now, it's still a wee boxy, of course, but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so, i'm keeping. even thinki\n",
      "I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.\n",
      "This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.\n",
      "I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.\n",
      "Just the perfect weight for summer wear. falls gently over tummy without being too long and the ruffled edge and quirky uneven length make it just interesting enough to make it feel like more than just a tee shirt. i got it in black and re-ordered in pale blue and am hoping the lighter color is not \"see-through.\" this is a nice buy on sale and can be dressed up or casual. it feels and wears great but i have not washed it so gave it a good on quality. if it washes well then an excellent would be\n",
      "My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white, yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft, it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts, jeans and leggings.\n",
      "The ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic, rather boxy shirt. it is a nice weight and drape, but please know it is a bit short and square. i love the asymmetrical ruffle, however, and think it makes this tee worth it.\n",
      "Runs really large. i am 5'4\", 120lbs, 32c, and had to exchange xs for xxs for width, but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.\n",
      "Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8\" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!\n",
      "...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.\n",
      "Great color fit was very true to size\n",
      "I really like this blouse. you could wear it tucked, but the pleats would disappear. my only complaint is that it's a bit too full round the waist. it would be a good choice for thanksgiving dinner!\n",
      "A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest\n",
      "I love this tee shirt. i love the higher neckline and the feminine and subtle ruffle at the bottom. it is my favorite tee by far! i am buying my second round of it now. i have one in coral, light blue and i am ordering more. the only down side is that both of my current shirts developed holes veyr quickly.; one on the shoulder and the other in the usual belly area that comes from the granite counter and jeans top button. there is no excuse for the shoulder holes in my mind...but i love the look\n",
      "This top is easy with nice hem detail.\n",
      "I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling\n",
      "Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering, the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral, and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering, i originally bought hte xs in the store, but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs, 5'1.5\" and 30 dd, with 26-27 waist). both fit, but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also, the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried\n",
      "I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.\n",
      "As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the \"denim' one (multicolor). i didn't end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i didn't love is it looks wrinkled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans, shorts, crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger, i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple, wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.\n",
      "The sweater is beautiful and lightweight. it is very short. i am short-waisted but felt that it was too cropped for me. the deign is lovely and the fabric is soft.\n",
      "Feminine but not too fussy tee is a nice linen-like material. i got the white one which will go with a lot of my skirts, pants and shorts. unlike other reviewers, i didn't find it too short for me at all, but i am high-waisted. casual but with extras.\n",
      "Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.\n",
      "Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent\n",
      "I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3\", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.\n",

      "I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.\n",
      "This cardigan is oh, so pretty! it does have a cropped length; it fall exactly at my waist.\n",
      "This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.\n",
      "Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.\n",
      "Nice top that can be worn alone or underneath a sweater. can be dressed up or down and worn in all seasons.\n",
      "I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.\n",
      "I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it. fits true to size and flattering for all busts. mom went up a size to be able to put a sweater underneath but she received lots of compliments at a recent function she wore this to. great lines.\n",
      "I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very \"busty\". i tried it on at the store, and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple, which i prefer. \r\n",

      "This shirt is awesome. i absolutely love the style of this shirt! it's super flowy, and is a really breathable fabric. i've been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants. the only downside is the quality of material. it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills. it also feels like it's going to start falling apart at the arm seams. nonetheless, i adore the shirt, and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season! no\n",
      "I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.\n",

      "runs a but large through the middle\n",
      "I liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store - the cotton is soft and comfortable, the colors are good (i tried on the white, charcoal, and light aqua blue), and the asymmetrical edge really makes it. the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style. however, my store doesn't have petite sizes, and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that wasn't super-flattering on me (at 5'1\"). it imay be an excelle\n",
      "I was looking for cute comfy stylish tees and was ecstatic when i came across this one. i purchased the coral and i love it! it's adorable on, i'm going to purchase another color. so happy!\n",
      "I think this top works best for a petite person. i am 5'1\" and 106 lbs. the xs is perfect for me. i love it so much, i purchased it in more colors. i machine washed and line dried. it washed beautifully.\n",
      "I read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable. i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist. the length hits me at the hip--i have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath.\n",
      "This is a great t-shirt; i love it. it fits great, isn't too bulky and has a great length to go with anything. i love it.\n",
      "A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.\n",
      "I bought this blouse in plum. it is very beautiful, and is a gorgeous color for fall. since i bought this in-person i decided to try it on. i am normally an x-small in retailer blouses. i tried on the x-small, and although it did fit, there isn't much room. this could be a problem for women who are bustier and fuller in the chest and arm area.\n",
      "This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit, flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing. i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter. my only complaint is that the sweater was pilling/shedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it. i hope that that doesn't happen every time that i wear it. i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing.\n",
      "I bought this in the white and it is super cute. more fitted at top, slightly belled at bottom and thankfully not see through\n",
      "I bought this in the sky color (and sized down from my normal medium) and absolutely love it. i don't think it's boxy at all. on the contrary, i love the way it hangs (i don't find it to be short either, though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath). p.s. the ruffle detail is precious!\n",
      "I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr\n",
      "Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.\n",
      "Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.\n",
      "definitely runs big\n",

      "for reference: 32d, 27, 35\n",
      "This shirt has a great fit and a nice change from the swing style. short in front and longer in back looks great with the higher waisted pants and traditional skinny. nice details on buttons and trim\n",
      "This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3\" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up. \r\n",
      "overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i\n",
      "I love this tee. as others have noted, the \"pink\" is really more of a coral orange, which is what i was hoping for. i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it.\n",
      "As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.\n",
      "This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still\n",
      "I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!\n",
      "Just loved it at first sight and waited for it to come on sale .. i am usually a size 0 or xsmall but this one fits perfectly with a size 2 .. i am about 122 lbs and 5 ft 2 and this size fits really well - - petite is too short esp on the arms -- the lining is really nice as well - the design and the cut of this coat is really flattering unlike some of the boxy designs -- absolutely divine - just loved it !!\n",

      "Love tracy reese finds at retailer! first day wearing this skirt and have already received a number of compliments! not a typical material i would buy clothing wise, but it's really comfortable and not clingy as i thought it may be. i appreciate the built in slip for some extra substance as well\n",
      "This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.\n",
      "I have been wanting this coat ever since i tried it on in the store a month ago. it's beautiful and well-made. it fits tts, but a snug tts, so if you are between sizes, i would order up. grab this asap while the price is right and it is still available!\n",
      "This skirt is true to size and very comfortable on! the colors are beautiful and deep! so glad i snagged this on sale! it will be a great piece to dress up or down depending on where i am going! love it! get it while you can!\n",
      "This is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants. i love the tucks in front with brass buttons. you don't have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head, i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter . i think this will be my go-to shirt this season.\n",
      "My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr\n",
      "This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most \"runs small\" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is\n",
      "I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat, i call this really a topper, because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit, i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece, i purchased the bailly 44 navy p\n",
      "This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! \r\n",

      "I bought this tee in gray and i liked it so much, i got the pink as well. it is not see through or sheer in either of the colors that i purchased. for reference, i am 5'2\" and the shirt hit at low hip. i ordered one size up for a\"swing\" look. very fresh, fun take on the basic tee. love it!\n",

      "This is an awesome t'shirt and i'm so glad it finally went on sale. i had been eying it for a while: it's true to size, can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans. washes great and looks different from other shirts -- the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference. gotten lots of compliments.\n",
      "I was going to order this coat online, but i ended up finding it in store. there wasn't a 2 petite available but the store had a 2 reg and i found it to fit well enough. i'm about 100 lbs with a 5 ft frame and a 34d chest. i was able to button up with a sweater underneath.\n",

      "I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.\n",
      "I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.\n",
      "This sweater is really beautiful! i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet! the fringe is perfect and flowy, a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room. tts, soft with no itch, really happy i bought it, and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love, because i know i will not want to pack it away. it fits just like the photo.\n",

      "I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 85 and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!\n",
      "Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.\n",
      "I'm a size 2 in retailer pretty much across the board - size 26/27 bottom, 2 top, generally go for the xs. and i ordered this in a 4 based on other reviews. it's definitely not a winter coat, which i understood. it's not for layering over a heavy sweater either. i wish i had ordered the size 2 instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist. as is i can wear it over a shirt, dress, or light sweater, and that's fine, but unlike other reviewers i don't think you need to size up if you want the\n",

      "Soft and flowy and perfect for those in-between seasons.\n",
      "I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the \"denim\" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!\n",
      "Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again, a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.\n",
      "From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.\n",

      "This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago, and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear, life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan, think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.\n",
      "This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly (size 8 top, 34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore\n",

      "This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7\", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!\n",
      "I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away! it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look! true to size.\n",
      "I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees, etc. are extra long, so it's nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5\" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot.\n",
      "Love this! it's loose and easy for summer, fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.\n",
      "There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!\n",
      "I love this coat! i purchased the size 6. i am a size 6 petite, but they were out. plus i wanted the coat to be a little longer. i wasn't a fan of how high it was on the model. it fit as i expected. i will have to take up the arm length, and it hit a little longer than it did on the model. i am 5' 120 pounds. 34c\n",

      "As other reviewers said, this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big, ordered a size down, & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally, i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra\n",
      "I bought this dress for an awards ceremony, and couldn't be more pleased. the quality and detailing on the dress are great, and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on. i love that it's machine washable on a delicate setting. i've already worn it twice, and can't wait to wear it again for easter.\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress and it was hard to let it go but, unfortunately, because the fabric is a little stiff, it accentuated my curvy back side in a bad way. it will definitely look great on someone with a smaller bottom. i tried the xs and did not experience the issues that other reviewers mentioned, such as the large arm holes.\n",
      "This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.\n",
      "This dress is lovely. the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors. the material is sturdy. the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust. the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the 6 regular even though i am only 5'4\". the pockets are a bonus!\n",
      "This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!\n",
      "This is so amazing! the dress is solid and will go under many different jackets kimonos and sweaters!\n",
      "Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo .\r\n",

      "this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined\n",
      "I bought this to wear to holiday parties, but it would work for any special occasion. the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background. the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge. i said it runs tts. i bought the size 2 and normally would wear a 2 or 4 in retailer dresses. the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips, so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type.. i did not have any issue with the armhole\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the \"look\" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.\n",
      "This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)\n",
      "Pictures don't do this dress justice, color in store is much more vibrant! embroidered flower is more orange/coral colored. also, at certain angles (depending on the lighting) this dress looks navy blue versus black, which i enjoyed. sizing - while i could have gotten away with my usual 8 the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a 6 for a more tailored look.\n",
      "I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5\" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!\n",
      "This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.\n",

      "I ordered a 6 and it fit great i am 5ft 3\" and 130lbs 34b in the chest! i love the fabric, i was drawn to it because i don't think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics. it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person. the embroidery makes the dress unique.\n",
      "This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.\n",
      "I love the idea of ruffles, but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium, and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes, it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer, but it's pretty thick.\n",
      "I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the m/l and fits well.\n",
      "I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny, but this blouse is cut correctly for it's size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down. \r\n",

      "the material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful. my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well.\n",
      "I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.\n",
      "I'm usually a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the 2 fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black, which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.\n",
      "This dress has the same bold, great color as the picture. although it has a big \"swing\" to it, because the upper portion is a bit fitted, i don't feel like i look pregnant. the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling. i'm very happy i bought it.\n",
      "Love embroidery!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous. i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it, but the cost was a deterrent. when it went on sale, i ordered it immediately. hoping it gets here soon! the fit is wonderful, length perfect, embroidery just beautiful, and quality is excellent. it is versatile, too; easy to dress down with a sweater and boots, and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding. for fit reference, i am 5'8\", 130 lb and ordered size 6 (this was the correct fit in the store). exci\n",
      "This dress was adorable. i found it to be a little too short for my taste- i'm 5'9\", and it hit mid thigh. i think you would probably see my rear if there were the slightest breeze, but it would be perfect on some shorter. embroidery was beautiful, and i loved the collar.  also a little sheer, but with nude colored under garments, it would've been fine. definitely try it out!\n",
      "This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.\n",
      "I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick, it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews, i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch, and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic, i was not surprised by the \"brightness\" of it like othe\n",
      "Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store, it looked more navy than black, but as i have it home, it is definite\n",

      "I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!\n",
      "This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.\n",
      "Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!\n",

      "This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.\n",
      "Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.\n",
      "It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.\n",
      "I was hoping this top would be a nice architectural piece to add to my wardrobe with its straight black line accents. sadly, in the end, it is just a t-shirt. a large t-shirt. i ordered my normal size (medium) and this shirt ran more like a large. i also did not like the way the neck was hemmed. the fabric folds over itself, when i think a better design would have been a more simple hem. i ended up returning this item due to its size.\n",
      "I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4\" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium, am 5'7\", 150 lbs, really am large boned, straight up and down.\n",
      "I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts, but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!\n",
      "As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9\" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.\n",
      "This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on, which i love. the floral pattern is delicate and subtle, and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce. it is so versatile! the quality is excellent. the skirt is fully lined. it will take me easily through three seasons (the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer). i'm so happy i bought this!\n",
      "I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.\n",
      "I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.\n",
      "How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.\n",
      "I just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing. why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model? i suspect the model has long arms, not little t-rex arms, so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist, while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow. it's a mystery. was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of? anyway, still a great dress, just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma\n",
      "Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi\n",

      "This is a cute, flattering dress, however the drop-waist, the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant, mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.\r\n",

      "This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.\n",
      "This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5\" and the length is just right, not too short.\n",

      "This skirt has a beautiful, flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and, of course, the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year, dressed up with jewels, or down with boots and a casual sweater.\n",
      "After reading all the reviews i figured at 40% off i could at least try it. i'm 5' 3\" and typically wear a m or size 10. i ordered the m, but as other reviews stated the arms were tight. since i'm expecting it to shrink, and want it to cover my booty, i ordered 2 colors in the l. it's exactly the oversized, slouchy look i wanted, without the neckline being too low, but will still be ok if it shrinks. i'll have these dry cleaned to minimize shrinkage. it's a wardrobe staple that looks great with\n",

      "I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3\" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.\n",

      "I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!\n",

      "Like the other reviewer mentioned, this jacket has a very trim fit, so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.\n",

      "First i must say that i bought this zip up hoodie because of the material and how incredibly soft and comfortable it was - absolutely worth the price. however, the sleeves were about 4\" too long! because i am a seamstress, and this was an easy hem for me i went ahead and purchased it and hemmed up the sleeves, but i was honestly shocked how long they were. you would have to have very long arms for this to fit you without alterations. if you don't mind rolling them up i suppose it might work as w\n",
      "I wanted this top to work so bad. unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isn't flattering if you aren't flat chested. it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone. i'm a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger, i don't recommend. however, if you are smaller busted, this piece would be worth the purchase.\n",

      "The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'4 and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!\n",

      "I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a \"swing\" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.\n",

      "This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times, and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters, and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.\n",
      "I love this sweater. i purchased it in the red/berry color. it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic! it hugs my curves in all the right places! i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions. but, after reading a couple of reviews here, i opted to wash on delicate and line dry. it came out perfectly!\n",
      "I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.\n",

      "Usually wear a small, sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small, if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws, so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great, medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.\n",

      "I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it.\n",

      "I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through, so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.\n",
      "I bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both! the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets. i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it. it fits true to size in my opinion.\n",

      "I love this turtleneck so much!! got it in black. looks great with skirts and under sweaters. love that you can wear the collar two ways. drapes and clings perfectly. the silver snaps along collar are such a nice detail. details like this is what makes retailer pieces so unique. love it! i am usually an xs or small in tops. 34b bra size. i ended up with the xs.\n",

      "I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2\", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.\n",

      "I spotted this pj pants in the store, tried it on, and love it! the material is very soft and comfortable. the fabric is on the thin side, thus, one star off the quality. the pattern/color varies, the one i got has more pinkish flowers. i am 5'2\", 120lbs, and size s fits nice. i could probably go down to a size xs, but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy, therefore size s fits better. the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite. it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe\n",
      "I ordered the neutral one with the fine stripe. it will layer nicely with neutral colored sweaters and blazers. the fabric is soft. the quality is good. the neck is cool that you can wear it two ways. overall, it is a good top. i think it's a little clingy, which highlights every flaw, in the back especially. i wouldn't size up. i still think it fits tts.\n",
      "I love this black turtleneck. arms are a little long, so should have gotten small. i wore it and love it! you can play with collar and snaps; up or down.\n",
      "I love this sweater, i bought the grey and the neutral one. it is very soft, has great color combos and seems to have minimal pulling. even though it's lightweight, it keeps me warm.\n",
      "Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.\n",
      "Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.\n",
      "Just a lovely soft and easy cover piece. the back is so different and interesting.\n",
      "This polo shirt has just the perfect amount of feminine detail to make it a great addition to my wardrobe. i love the shorter version, and it looks great with both jeans or skirts.\n",
      "This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!\n",
      "Cool color, great feel to this sweater. nice with jeans, skirts, etc. very cozy to wear. i just want to keep grabbing it every morning.\n",
      "I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.\n",
      "Nice piece. the fabric is very stretchy with that heavy luxe kind of feeling. the neck snap placket is genius because when it is snapped up the neck stays up without restricting the throat. nice long lenght too.\n",
      "I got this in the red. it is a muted color that is very pretty. i am 5'5\", and it is neither too long nor too short. it is a nice, light weight. the quality is good and on par with other purchases from this brand.\n",
      "Great spin on a basic turtleneck! i like it unbuttoned just as must as buttoned! material is super soft. good length.\n",
      "I liked this so much that i bought it in all three colors, but send berry color back. the top is flattering and looks good. i did wash it at home, it seems to shrink a bit. but i ordered up for longer length. i really like the style. it is perfect to wear by itself or as a layer. perfect for fall and winter.\n",
      "And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there's no way i can keep it.\n",
      "I love this top. i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small. i am 5'7\" 145lbs 34g chest. the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs. it is stretchy but fits wonderfully. i bought the black. i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck. i'm wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats. i feel like audrey hepburn!! i will not be dry cleaning it. i will wash\n",
      "I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.\n",
      "I am in love with this dress and can't wait to wear it to brunch this weekend! i am normally a ps, but they only had the pxs which i took a chance on. fits like a glove. slightly tight in the chest area, but i am chesty for a petite girl. the length is perfect and modest, the detail up front is adorable.\n",

      "The pattern, while beautiful, is on a much more yellow-ivory background than pictured. the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose, like it would not support the skirt. while i did like it, i didn't love it, so it had to go back.\n",
      "I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of \"cozying up\" in colder weather by wrappi\n",

      "The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately, the 2nd suit i received was also \"off center\". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.\n",
      "Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!\n",
      "I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top, dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!\n",
      "Beautiful dress.  the  printed material under the tulle however hung 3 inches lower than the tulle skirt. i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of  tulle skirt because it looked awkward. even after paying full price for the dress i didn't mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful.\n",
      "I love the fit of this sweater. i recently had a baby and am a little self-conscious of my stomach area. the sweater, in my usual size s, hides my problem area without being big and boxy. the weave seems like it will be prone to snags, so i'll have to be careful.\n",
      "Fit great and cute. cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals.\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6\" and 110 lbs, slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!\n",
      "I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes, it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.\n",
      "This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.\n",
      "Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me! love the material, style, just doesn't look right on me!\n",
      "I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5'5\". the way these hung on me (at 5'2\") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.\n",
      "I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5\" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l\n",

      "These jeans immediately caught my eye online, and when i saw them in the store on display, i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit, and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today, and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.\n",

      "I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.\n",
      "I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.\n",
      "The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star\n",
      "I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.\n",

      "This is a fantastic dress for fall, if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l, rather than in particular dress sizes, so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give), but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo), with a tightness at the clavicle, and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.\r\n",

      "Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it, and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great, drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape, but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.\n",

      "This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo! i was instantly attracted to it! upon trying on, i was surprised at how soft the fabric was. definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise! i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else! i can't wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top!! i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top!!\n",
      "I absolutely love this jacket! i wear it almost everyday. works as a cardigan or a jacket. my favorite retailer purchase so far:)\n",
      "Wow this is a keeper. love how soft and special the color feels. the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear. not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted. love it with jeans since the back ends at waist.\n",
      "Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt, with artistic flair and a figure flattering, unique cut. it works very well on me as i'm a petite large. i only wish it was a little roomier, or that i was 10 lbs lighter, but it's stretchy and i really love wearing it. the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension.\n",
      "I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store, and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite, 32dd, usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit, i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length, but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors, and although the front is polyester, the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting, shorter tops, so i\n",
      "The colors on this top are beautiful, even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work, back it goes.\n",
      "I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.\n",
      "This dress is absolutely darling! it is light as a feather and floats on the body. the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream. i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich. super comfortable and i know i'll get lots of wear out of it. you can dress it up or dress it down. love it!\n",
      "Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the \"captain kangaroo\" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.\n",
      "I love this cardigan. it's quite luxurious and roomy and long in the front, leaving lots to wrap around yourself. the back is more cropped\n",
      "and slim fitting to help balance. this is so soft and warm, i love it. definitely bulky and cozy, not fitted. but perfect for a casual look. i'm usually a medium in sweaters but got a small in this, and it's still a little loose which is perfect.\n",
      "This top is very cute, very flattering, and very unique! love the high/low back! also very comfy, would recommend to anyone!\n",
      "I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2\", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a \"petite\" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th\n",
      "Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts, just as shown on model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6\" and the m fit perfectly!'\n",
      "The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.\n",
      "I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!\n",
      "This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2\" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!\n",
      "As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.\n",
      "These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!\n",
      "Absolutely love this jacket.initially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket, which looks similar to this one, and tried them both on in store. the latter just didn't drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me, but this piece is amazing! it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look. the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacket,middle bottom, which is a bit of an added but subtle flair, the color is a bit more 't\n",
      "\n",
      "I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews. i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy. yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days. but it hits right at the waistline without being too short. super vibrant colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am short waisted and i still thought the pleats started too high on me. also, the whole thing was a little bit big. i always wear a medium, but in this top the shoulders and everything was just a bit large. since i bought it online, i couldn't size down. the fabric was a nice quality.\n",
      "I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon\n",
      "The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me.\n",
      "This shirt is semi-fitted. i like it because it is not boxy but not overly tight. it is not heavy even though it is a sweatshirt material. i wish the neck was a bit higher but i will wear a tee under it. the back is really cute. \r\n",
      "it is different and i like that.\n",
      "I do not understand how a couple people gave this a bad review. i loved this jacket from the minute i tried it on. cute in the picture and cuter on, because it is so comfortable. the fabric is super soft and does not wrinkle (as one reviewer stated). i took it on the plane with me just to keep warm and it was fabulous. looked as good going on the plane as it did coming off. the drape of the jacket flows nicely and i love the oversized pockets to stash my phone or lipstick. this jacket will carry\n",
      "This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.\n",
      "This top is made from a thick, sweatshirt-type fabric, making it a nice choice for transitional weather. the details are quite unusual and lovely. i just got it and i've already worn it twice.\n",
      "This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.\n",
      "This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews\n",
      "Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4, 112 lbs, broad shoulders, athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large, but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed, i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.\n",
      "No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft. i couldn't pass it up and wish it came in more colors!\n",
      "Love this & so cute to have t-shirt with additional details. usually get medium size in blouses but liked the fit of the large better.\n",
      "Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu\n",
      "I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store. it is a beautiful dress. not see through at all. substantial weight, not to heavy and so very beautiful. i stayed tts on it . i would have purchased it but was buying 3 other dresses.. i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days.\n",
      "I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..\n",
      "I love this top. i got the blue, the colors are deep and just beautiful\r\n",
      "i'm normally a large, so i feel this top runs large. i got the medium and it fits perfect \r\n",
      "it is long, i'm 5'6\" and it hits the bottom of my butt. \r\n",
      "you won't be disappointed, try this top\n",
      "Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist, and it was still too short for me. :-(\n",
      "I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i'll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn't too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i'm normally a small/4 in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large.\n",
      "As a curvy, short gal, finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work, and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like, and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!\n",
      "I love this shirt. great mix of chic, comfortable and feminine! can wear for many occasions!\n",
      "I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i can't have everything!\n",
      "I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and, imho, the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2\" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long, but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i\n",
      "Very happy with this top! love the design--very different. also like that the front panel is different fabric. buttons also are a fun detail. great shirt to transition from summer to fall. i usually wear xs or s--ordered this in xs and perfect fit. going to be a favorite.\n",
      "I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week, but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also, the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.\n",
      "I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed, but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!\n",
      "This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.\n",
      "I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about htis top, it is a nice shape and comfortable, fits triue t o size, but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs, 3-dd chest).\n",
      "This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well.\r\n",
      "the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !\n",
      "I had to go up one size, but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work, and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest, but the next size up fit perfect!\n",
      "Like others are saying, the sleeve and bust are running small.  i found out that when i was trying the blue color one (butterfly).  however, before trying the blue one, i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size (s), it fit me perfectly, no issue with the sleeve and bust.  i don't understand why they're different.\n",
      "Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.\n",
      "I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better)\n",
      "I love the look of this tee, casual, but with some interesting details that make it more flattering and wearable than a plain tee. i tried on my regular size xs and it was large and frumpy, so i was initial disappointed. however, when it was on promo i decided to try the xxs, and it made a huge difference. if you size down it is great and looks like it does on the model. i ordered the coral and it is a beautiful color. the dye seems to be uneven, as it is darker in some parts. for this reason i\n",
      "The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.\n",
      "This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.\n",
      "I purchased the tan \"ish\" gray colored one in xs. it looks a bit mauve in the pictures, but is still very beautiful.. i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front. the one drawback is that the arms are very snug, especially the upper arm and chest. i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up. just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small.\n",
      "I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5'8\" and 140 lbs. so it's unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps, but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance.\n",
      "This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!\n",
      "The shirt design is very nice, but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.\n",
      "I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1, around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut\n",
      "I bought this top after seeing it featured on a style blog. i was really excited to wear it until i realized how see thru it was. i had to put a cami underneath which detracted from the beauty of the top. even my flesh toned bra showed thru so i sadly had to return it.\n",
      "This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.\n",
      "Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!\n",
      "I love this blouse. it is perfect for a curvy figure. i think it runs true to size. maybe size up if you have a larger chest. i love how it is so feminine yet structured. the fabric is lovely, soft and structured all at once. love the knot, i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldn't leave the store without it. it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay $$$ for a perfect fit!\n",
      "For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.\n",
      "I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.\n",
      "Good weight and texture to the dress but looked to tent-like for me. even taking it out of the package my first thought was, is this size mislabeled? i got a 0 but could probably have done better with 00 if those were in stock or if petite sizes were still available. returning but wish i could keep it\n",
      "I loved the mauve color! i loved the idea of the heathered fabric and lace insets, but the linen was rough and scratchy. my regular size was boxy and a little too short! \r\n",

      "I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print, i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.\n",
      "A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.\r\n",
      "the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.\r\n",

      "flattering fit for curvy figure.\n",
      "Comfy, gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing. the white is totally see through just fyi. i don't think it's the best quality but totally worth the sale price. i got the m and it's loose and flowy in a good way.\n",
      "The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.\n",
      "This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin, and had to return it because of this. otherwise, it would have been a keeper.\n",
      "I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.\n",
      "The detail and overall quality of the fabric is incredible. i normally avoid swing dresses, but this is a flattering dress. i typically wear between sizes 2-6 (depending on designer) and a 6 fit me perfectly. i'm extremely happy that i purchased it and received compliments as soon as i wore it out. i'm also tall, so i have to be concerned with length of dresses and this falls perfectly right at the top of the knee.\n",
      "The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get \"stuck\" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....\r\n",

      "The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!\n",
      "This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!\n",
      "This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.\n",
      "I'm a size xl, so my review might not apply to all people. i purchase my retailer tops in size xl and sometimes they fit great and sometimes they don't. when i put this top on it looked like i was wearing an open cardigan; nowhere near buttoning. i have some sewing experience, so i removed all 4 box pleats which gave me an additional 8 inches of fabric. after doing this i was able to easily button up the blouse and have it lay nicely. but i literally needed that extra 8 inches of fabric in the mid\n",

      "I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile, and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures, but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft, not crisp, and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing, though. it's a bit sheer, but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular, rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2, but had to size up to a 4 regular to avoid gaping in f\n",

      "Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes, size down.\n",
      "The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top, arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.\n",
      "I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back\n",
      "I am 5' 8\", 145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j\n",
      "I loved the print on both, but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit, size down. for myself, m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long, covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design, so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.\n",
      "Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me.  fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt.  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try.  i don't think i have the right personality for this one.  looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!\n",
      "The label says 100% linen, but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit, but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape, but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much, i just bought another one in mauve.\n",
      "Saw this top in store months ago but couldn't justify paying full price. when i saw it on sale i had to get it! it's flattering on both me and my mom, and we wear xs and l - good for a lot of body types since the fit is more loose. the top is more sheer than pictured, but it should be fine with a tank underneath. i plan on wearing it when going out with friends :)\n",
      "Love the lattice inserts, makes it feel like you have ventilation which is nice on a hot summer day. i purchased this in grey and in xs. i normally wear m for a looser fit, s for a more fitted look, so i was really surprised that an xs worked for me and was fitted. i haven't worn it since i washed it though. decided to buy the white but in a small, pretty but very see thru. will need to wear a shirt underneath, a little bummed because i liked the breeze! one other comment, this shirt is long! wh\n",
      "This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it\n",
      "Love the the pattern on these tops. i got the grey and got a ton of compliments on it. the fabric is a great weight for fall. it does fit on the larger side so i would definitely size down. i got the xs and wish xxs had been available.\n",
      "As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.\n",
      "I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture, it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters), so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0, but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie, it can be cinched in to create\n",
      "I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen, i usually don't like linen much, it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.\n",
      "This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!\n",
      "The petites fit perfect!!  these are so comfortable, i will get much us out of them!\n",
      "I bought the size 27 in these - i'm usually a 27 or 28 (measurements 27-38), and they fit perfectly. i'm more of a pear shape and they're very flattering. the moss color is lovely and will go with a lot, and they can be dressed up or down.\n",

      "I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium, i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.\n",
      "Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.\n",
      "I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c\n",

      "I'm 5'5\", 115 lbs, with a 25\" waist and 35\" hips. i purchased a 25 and the fit was perfect. i'm just a bit short waisted, have a rather small waist and often find that pants of any kind gap at the back. these fit perfectly, felt great on, and i love the fabric.\n",
      "This is a very pretty sweater and the neutral color works well with everything. the detail in the back makes it unique. it runs large though, so size down. the sleeves by the cuffs do tend to stretch out easily, but it washes well, so it's not a big issue..\n",
      "Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi\n",
      "Loved my. mustard colored ones so much, i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!\n",
      "I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24, i wouldn't bother with these.\n",
      "I'm a 5'7\"and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!\n",
      "I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.\n",
      "I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves, which are fine, but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side, but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,\n",
      "Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful, the color lovely, the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror, it just was too much material, too big a bell shape. oh well, still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.\n",
      "I tried on a returned 24p in my store, they were almost the right length, but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt, and 115 lbs). they were nice though, kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey, can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low, at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.\n",
      "I like this jacket, very neutral in color, classic cut and vintage like old retailer. unfortunately, i ordered xs p and not xxs p... and i found it wasn't right on me, a little loose, so not as flattering. i understand that jackets are meant to be worn over things, but i didn't love the look. some may find the material itchy, fine for me, but i am not as sensitive as others (can do small amounts of wool). i am 115 lbs, 30 dd and 26.5 in waist, for reference with sizing,.\n",
      "This one is way better in person. admittedly, i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well, it is great. a little sheer, adn super static-y when i received it, but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking, but this doe'n'tt come in petites,so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too, neutral, event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish, it stil lcan be worn with anything..\n",
      "I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.\n",
      "These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am 5 foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldn't work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s\n",
      "The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.\r\n",
      "however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4\", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to \"sew away\" the \"wings\" on both si\n",

      "I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy, soft, great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan, it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms, which i love.\n",
      "I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!\n",
      "This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.\n",
      "This top is beautifully made, but comfortable. the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering. the length is just short enough that it doesn't look like a dress.\n",
      "Beautiful design and soft, warm wool. warm enough to have on outside in the fall (i live in pdx), and also stylish enough to keep on inside. buy the right size (not too big) because it's meant to fit on the waist and the skirt swings out from there!\n",
      "Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.\n",
      "In paper crown dresses, i wear a small or size 6, so for this top, i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference, i'm 5'7\", 130 lbs, 34a. it is very wide towards the bottom, and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff, so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs, i think the bottom would still look unflattering, so i'm returning this.\n",
      "I'm a little on the short side, i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.\n",
      "So glad i purchased this tunic! just lovely. can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer. necklace friendly too!\n",
      "Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!\n",
      "Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.\n",
      "I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!\n",
      "I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.\n",
      "I am 5-9 1/2\" tall, 150 lbs, i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also, they did not have my size in store, so they had them shipped, for free, to my home. received them within 3 business days.\r\n",

      "This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring, as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless, sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect, just wish retailer has more offerings like this.\n",
      "Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past, and i love it to bits! \r\n",
      "i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.\r\n",
      "(it's true that this sweater isn't lined, but to my mind, it would be a crime\n",
      "This shirt is more beautiful in person. it has a lovely hand feel (soft) and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant. i bought it for my 13 year old niece. she loved it! she may have to return for a small, but i do feel the size ran true to size. it depends on how you want to wear it.\n",
      "This top is so gorgeous! the color, the embroidery, the neckline, are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part, but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.\n",
      "Gorgeous embroidering and feel -- very soft for wool. this is a lot lighter than more jackets but with good layering can be worn in the winter. i'm 5ft tall and 150 lbs, curvy and hourglass; this hugs my curves beautifully in a size small and gives me a feminine shape. it runs up to my knees and the sleeves are a bit long which will be hemmed soon. i wanted the petite but it was sold out, honestly this is perfect minus the arms. the quality is gorgeous -- so soft and inviting to wear. it runs la\n",
      ".unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips, so it wasn't very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd, and off center. i had to return. pretty color, though.\n",
      "These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8\" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.\n",
      "Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful, the embroidery is gorgeous, i feel so feminine in this coat\n",

      "This is classic retailer at it's best.  quality   style   a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come.  first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/4 length coat.  versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay\n",
      "Cute, comfy, and would highly recommend them to others. i plan on getting one more color because i feel like i will wear them all the time!\n",
      "Love the design!! it's screams retailer and is form fitting, flattering, and super cute!! however the material has the itch factor for me. it's not lined and therefore quite scratchy along the collar as well. what a shame.\n",
      "Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!\n",
      "The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2\", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos.\n",
      "Very cute and great fit. i removed the belt (it's removable) for a different look.\n",
      "I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online (even more so). the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my 5'4\" (129 lb) 34c frame. if your on the fence on this one, get it. it's worth the purchase!\n",
      "I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms, very soft. high quality.\n",
      "I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.\n",
      "These chinos are really soft and comfortable, but they run really large. i have the 27 petite (5'4\" 115 lbs.) and they are too big. i originally bought the 28 petite and exchanged them for the 27 and after wearing the 27s all day i have realized they are significantly too big. they stretch as you wear them so they ended up completely saggy in the butt and hanging around my hip bones. i was in the store today and tried on a pair in 26 regular and those were also too big; i didn't have time to try\n",
      "Beautifully constructed and designed, this lovely sweater coat from rosie neira makes me anticipate fall weather more than i should. the fit is perfect for light layering and has a feminine silhouette. the wool feels like all my other boiled wool pieces--it's soft, slightly itchy, but tolerable. i wear a layer anyway so i hardly notice. just be aware for those that are extra sensitive. i purchased size mp and my stats are 5'3\" 135# 38/28/35\n",

      "Super soft, cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round, although with its lighter weight, it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it's gorgeous. i have it on right now!\n",
      "These are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot. however, my normal 25 was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house, they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every 2 seconds. i ordered the black, mostly because i wasn't crazy about any of the other colors. if there were any colors left in a 24 that i could see myself wearing, i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me. i think if they fit you well a\n",
      "This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap.\n",
      "I love tiny tops- they fit great. i buy a small. i wish this was a henly style like some of their past versions of this embroidered style top but i still ike it and will get a lot of wear out of it. at first i thought it was too much detal but it grew on me after pulling an outfit together. won't dissapoint.\n",
      "Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos.\r\n",
      ".\r\n",
      "i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38\" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t\n",
      "The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.\n",
      "I loved this on the mannequin and assumed it would look terrible on me. i tried it on anyway and was delightfully surprised. i tried a small and it was too roomy in the top so i opted for the extra small. i'm 5'6\" and 130 lbs, (27 in jeans, 34a). my booty definitely fills it out but the rest of the fit is similar to the model. it is hard to get on and off but if you tie a looser bow before slipping it over your head it's much easier to get back on and you can tighten it up again fairly easily. f\n",
      "This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldn't lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.\n",
      "Love the blue color, different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff, but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.\n",
      "I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.\n",
      "I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. i have not seen anyone complain about this, but on me, the mock neck collapses in and looks messy. unfortunately i returned both. i sew, and i do not understand why this happened.\n",
      "I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.\n",
      "Perfect fit for my size. it elongate my petite frame.\n",
      "This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale\n",
      "Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.\n",
      "I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi\n",
      "Well first off i knew a jumpsuit was going to be a gamble for me- i have a long torso at 6 feet , but i just loved the print and the style and typically all things sactuary so i was willing to risk it.\n",
      "sadly the torso length was an issue and it seemed to run small to me-i ordered a small which usually would fit fine, but ended up pulling across my hips and with the patten being what it is... well on me it just wasn't flattering or comfortable.\n",
      "I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.\n",
      "Love the blue color, and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair. the hem is cool. love the big cuffs. but i looked like the liberty bell in the small. it is huge through the hips! not at all like on th model. i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms. returned :(\n",
      "This sweater is pretty, the cut is very flattering, both colors are nice (i ordered both), but i decided to reutn both only because i have enough sweaters and live in southern california... otherwise, say go for it. it is well made and woud definitely keep me warm. i also like the mock neck, the long sleeve \"hem\" and contrasting colors... i tried on petite xs, which was perfect for me #5'1.5\", 115 lbs#.\n",
      "I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d, 31 waist, 38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said, even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first, it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back, get all four panels even, tied, hiding my bra, etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga, i may not have managed. once on, the style looked great. as\n",
      "This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode\n",
      "High quality, and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.\n",
      "This top does look as pictured, the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time, they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great, but on it's on, i don't know, just not for me. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lb\n",
      "This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover\n",
      "I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but, as soon as i tried it on, i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.\n",
      "It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.\n",
      "I purchased this top (i thought of it as a sweater) to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it's super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i haven't seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love!\n",
      "Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also, i found the fit flattering at the hips, following my hourglass shape withou\n",
      "I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose, and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price, i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.\n",
      "I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable.\n",
      "My retailer location only had the blue option, which i found to be very appealing and better in person for the following reasons:\n",
      "__________\n",
      "pros:\n",
      "- lighter knit like others mentioned.\n",
      "- the blue is a deep blue with threads of shimmery black that give it a more elegant touch while still being casual. i didn't see the grey, so i cannot compare the two differences, but i found the blue color lovely.\n",
      "- this looks much better in person!\n",
      "- it sat well on my tall frame of 5'9\", 36 c, wide hips, and hour\n",
      "This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.\n",
      "Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.\n",
      "I was thinking this would be a straight up terry cloth athleisure top, but the subtle metallic thread woven into the cloud gray fabric elevates the style. really loved the top because of the cut and interesting hemline, but i adore it for the bit of sparkle.\n",
      "One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.\n",
      "I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.\n",
      "My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.\n",
      "Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body\n",
      "Tried on the blue in xsp and xs, tried the grey in xxs. i'm 5'2\", currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and a long torso.\r\n",
      ".\r\n",
      "the blue version runs very wide in the hips compareed to the grey, but is very fitted at the top, giving it a trapeze shape. not a good look on my pear shape. the sleeves on the petite size were a better fit, but it was shorter than on the model. the grey is more slender with very snug arms that do stretch out.\r\n",
      ".\r\n",
      "a pass for me, even though i love the mostly cotton fa\n",
      "I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on, on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.\n",
      "I didn't thoroughly read the description of this product, so when it arrived i was surprised to see the thread was sparkly. i tried it on and the neckline is absolutely beautiful and feminine. it looks like a masculine cut on the model, but it's actually a really beautiful neckline with flared flowing bottom to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "my only complaint is that it looks a tad longer on the model then it is is real life. i'm 5'9\" and it shows most of my behind, unlike the length of the model where it seems more like\n",
      "Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.\n",
      "Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms, the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south, but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin, but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8, weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8, but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.\n",
      "This top is the best summer top ever. looks great, washes great, packs great. i get compliments whenever i wear it. fit is true to size. goes with everything.\n",
      "I think this top looks lovely; however, it does not fit my body shape. i am an hourglass shape. the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didn't drape nicely around my waist/hips like on the model. i think top could look great on someone who has a lean, square, or athletic build.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "also, this top definitely runs large. according to the retailer size chart, i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements, but this top was much too large overall in a small and still\n",
      "So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight, the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue), the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately, i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g), so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular, which hopefully will have a little more room, but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!\n",
      "This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr\n",
      "It fits perfectly, slim but not clingy, and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.\n",
      "This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove, very flattering.& got lots of compliments.\r\n",
      "i am 5'4\" and 125 lbs, i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)\n",
      "Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is, with a cardi, denim jacket, leggings/tights and boots, etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4, particularly in the chest (i'm 34a), and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5'7\"). the neckline is cut somewhat low, but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (don't feel need for cami). very\n",

      "Beautiful. did not look like much on the hanger, but this is a beauty. give it a try!\r\n",
      "i am 5'10; normally a size 6 and the small fits perfectly. it should be loose fitting, with a dropped, not so obvious flounce. the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts!\n",
      "I love this dress! purchased it in pink and then in the blue color. it's perfect for any occasion and is very comfortable. i feel like it fits true to size and was not to revealing in the front however if i was to wear this to work it would need a cami underneath. it is not lined as well. love this dress! buy it in every color!\n",
      "I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown, but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere, which just seems wrong in this style pant. also, take note, these are slit up the side, which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit, but still, does c\n",
      "This is a great throw on and go dress. it would work great with a sweater and tights or by itself in the hottest of weather. it looks a lot less awkward on than the picture online indicates.\n",
      "I saw this dress in the new arrivals in red, and it caught my attention, but not enough to order it (the pictures online for other colors didn't look that great). well, i saw the black in the store and decided to try it on as it looked like hte cut would be cute. it fit like a glove and i actually love the pattern. i ordred the peite to compare, and also the red to see in person... we shall see which is the winnrer!\n",
      "I love the idea but it is more of a over sweater than to wear by itself like model... too big/baggy\n",
      "Really liked this dress, but it ran too big for me.\n",
      "Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4\", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.\n",
      "Dress is cute and comfortable to wear. i bought the black motif in regular size 0. it fits perfectly and falls just above my knees. i have washed it in the washing machine placed in a large zippered mesh bag and hung it to dry. as mentioned in previous reviews, with the exception of it being unlined, it's a wonderful dress and am so happy to have it.\n",
      "Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!\n",
      "I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6\" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.\n",
      "Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how \"voluminous\" the cut\n",
      "Beautiful thick sturdy denim. probably the best denim i own in terms of the material. the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat. however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price, totally worth it.\n",
      "I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first, the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second, it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3\", 110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors, it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also, it is like a heavy sweater, not a\n",
      "I bought this dress in black with the polka dot pattern, and the style is adorable. i love the empire waist and the fit is very flattering. the v does come down a bit low, but a cami can be work underneath for more coverage. my main complaint is the fabric. it is very thin and wrinkles extremely easily. luckily the dark color hides this, but it's a bit disappointing how easily it wrinkles.\n",

      "great style with leggings or tights - really an all-season dress, though. ran very large for me - i purcha\n",
      "I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.\n",
      "Well made garment. i love the colors, fabric and flounce at the bottom. the top is a little large on top with large armholes, but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day.\n",
      "I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38\" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry\n",
      "I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0, usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light, definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying, but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!\n",
      "I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it! on the site i thought it was just \"meh\" but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected. it definitely runs large, i sized down to an xs (usually a s, size 4/6) and it's still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy, the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck isn't at all tight. it's soft and just an overall cute sweater!\n",
      "Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress! i bought the red color in petite and love it. i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear. i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isn't what it was.\n",
      "Lovely top, well made and feels wonderful on. attention petites - i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured.\n",
      "I am 5'9 135lbs, small chest and narrow shoulders. the 6 fits me perfectly. i love the fact that there is a hem, if i decide to let it down just a little. being over 60 and tall, it is so disappointing to find a dress you love but is just a little too short. the fabric is not too heavy for our moderate summers and i think i will wear this often.\n",
      "I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful, but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so, it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang, the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem, but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t\n",
      "When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9\" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.\r\n",

      "i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!\n",
      "I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2, 125 pounds and usually, wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small, but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine, but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed, but it looks ok rolled up too.\n",
      "Really love it - soft and nice quality - only complaint is the straps are too long for a normal sized torso. the front drapes below my breasts at the tightest /smallest setting.\n",
      "This shirt is wonderful! i totally recommend it for everyone.\n",
      "I liked this dress, but had some issues. i am 5' 3\" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear, so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren't for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it.\n",
      "For reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.\n",
      "As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1\" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly.\n",
      "Love this dress! but don't wash it! it shrinks about 2 inches making it way too short for me! it should be dry clean only!\n",
      "Grabbed this off the sales rack-not expecting much-but it is a great sweater! like other reviewers mentioned-roomy but still form fitting. i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great. cozy, warm, very cute. i usually wear a small but got an xs in this. a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics.\n",

      "Love, love, love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!\n",
      "This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!\n",
      "I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small, but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.\n",
      "I didn't look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top.  it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors.  but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.\n",
      "Although seemingly simple, this hooded sweater top is actually versatile. wear with jeans or leggings, even a skirt. wear over a cami, tank or even sleeved top. i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable. would recommend.\n",
      "Comfortable fabric and beautiful print! light enough for the summer but is also great for fall.\n",
      "These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...\n",
      "\n",
      "The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.\n",
      "This shirt fits well, is flattering, and has a really pretty pattern to it. the lace adds a romantic touch that sets it apart. it's also incredibly soft and comfortable.\n",
      "I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket, but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but, i live in california, so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too \"classic\" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it\n",
      "I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit, but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out, but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.\n",
      "I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!\n",
      "I love everything about this dress. cute, comfortable, easy to wear. it does wrinkle a little and it's not lined but otherwise, i love it.\n",
      "Every once in a while, i randomly pick something from the sales floor that really knocks it out of the park. print is subtle and pretty, crochet neck really lightens up the look of a long top with a lot of coverage. it's cut perfectly--beautifully drapes without being so flowy it's mistaken for maternity. worth full price! word of warning, i saw one top on the rack with a small amount of crochet that was unraveling, so may need to check before buying. i'm usually a size 6-8, purchased size small\n",
      "I bought this dress in the blue print and love it! the drape is lovely and its not too short. i feel like it can be dressed up or down. i plan to wear it to a wedding at the end of the month. for reference, my measurements are 36-27-38 (chest 36d and height 5'4) and i ordered the small. i'm usually a small-medium but went with a small based on other reviews. i have a short torso as well and i feel this dress fits perfectly, not too small or too large. as other reviewers stated, there is no linin\n",
      "Very flattering to a woman's figure. can dress up or down.\n",
      "I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al\n",
      "This is a stunning, flattering, well-designed and sized, magnificent, and yet wearable, comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty, 34f, size 8, and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of \"give\". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back, which can happen for me. the bottom 2\" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top, so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet\n",
      "Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably, looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow, gives it a vintage vibe.\n",
      "This is a pretty, yet comfortable dress. perfect to wear to work or out to brunch with the girls.\n",
      "This is a fun little dress, with a nice double seam bodice detail. i'm large busted and it's very flattering. also, in my size (12) the hem hit just at the top of the knee, which i prefer. great with tights and booties, or boots. cute with a sweater. all around very wearable and a nice holiday option.\n",
      "I love the simplicity of this. it's not fussy at all. i fell in love with the green color online. fortunately someone had returned a green to my closest store though it wasn't my size. the color is even better in person.i tried on the blue (also pretty) in a 8 and 10, as i'm all over the place in retailer sizing. i could've taken either but the 10 had too much material on top for me. i ordered the 8. i'm hoping it won't be too short for church.\n",
      "I've never been so bummed a dress didn't work for me. this is so cute. i love that it's got a bit of a sleeve. it's one of those easy, pop-it-on-and-go pieces i'd love to have in my closet. i'm 5'2\" and i tried on a 6p in the store and it was prefect except for the bust. the elastic peaked in the front and i can't imaging this dress working on anyone with more than a b cup. (i'm a d and it looked ridiculous in the bodice). i tried on a 6, and the proportions were all off. if the elastic went str\n",
      "I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.\n",
      "I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.\n",
      "This ia a great casual top...the design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier look...the length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and arm...would like to add that while it is good quality it's still somewhat overpriced for a t -shirt material top, lace accent..\n",
      "I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a \"flowy\" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor\n",
      "I love this skirt! it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt, that brought me to retailer in the first place. as the first reviewer said, this is a well-made striking skirt. it is tts (i usually wear a size 2 - and the size 2 fit perfectly; i am 36-17-36, and 122 lbs, 5'4\".) the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear.\n",
      "I like this sweater vest - really nice quality. looks great with ankle lenght jeaens and booties or a shorter skirt as shown on the model. quality is really nice - it's fairly heavy. i love the slits on the slide. i do find it runs a big large.\n",
      "Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!\n",
      "After eyeing this product online for awhile, i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did, because while this dress is lovely, it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h,) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally, the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders, which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft, and the\n",
      "Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.\n",
      "I love this shirt. it is very soft and the lace on the sleeves adds an extra element. i liked this shirt so much, that i ordered a second one.\n",
      "The design of this top and colors are amazing! the only complaint i have is that it is quite large. i should have sized down. needless to say i kept it as a summer to fall transition piece!\n",
      "This dress looked ok in the hanger, but oh my on was so much better. quality is great, i love the fabric and that it has pockets.\r\n",
      "i'm 5'8 and normally a ddd usually a large too...so i worried about the size - the medium fits great everywhere\n",
      "This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.\n",
      "Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.\n",
      "I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best. for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am 4ft 10\"! \r\n",
      "the color is a beautiful dark blue( not sure why the color online says charcoal) and the opening at the chest area is a little low, but nothing that double sided tape can not fix.  another bonus, as other reviewers have stated,  is that you can wear a regular bra. lastly it does not wrinkle, so you can bring this on vacation\n",
      "I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.\n",
      "This top does run quite large. i am normally an xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7\", 130lbs, 34a), and i was debating between the xs and xsp. the xxs was out of stock, so i wasn't able to try it on for size. the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model, but it was also a little too low cut for me on top. the straps are twisted and not adjustable, so i went with the xsp, which is what i'm wearing in the photo. it does come up a little shorter, but it fits me better in the bust. the f\n",
      "Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough\n",
      "This dress fits so well, it is extremely well cut and flattering. the length is perfect (i am 5'5).  i passed on it though, because i didn't love the color. almost like a navy blue that has been washed one too many times. if this dress had more color options or made in a cute print i would not hesitate to buy it. if blue is your color go for it.\n",
      "My imagination went wilt with all of the possible combinations for this vest. dressy and casual...with jeans or slacks; long or short pencil; leather too!\n",
      "best gift to date.\n",
      "This just arrived and it looks exactly like the photo. very well made, crisp and lovely. not see thru at all which is a plus. a bit overpriced but going to keep it.\n",
      "This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.\n",
      "I tried on the white top at the store. the quality was very good and i loved the overall concept of the design. the dark stripes on the back are slightly raised, giving it a nice texture. the fabric was soft and comfortable. however, the shape just didn't drape as well on me as i had hoped, so ultimately i didn't buy it. perhaps a petite length would have fit me better.\n",
      "I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2\") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.\n",
      "Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy, dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.\n",
      "This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!\n",
      "This tank is pretty. it looks nice and is not cut too low. the bottom is \"flowy\" and not extremely fitted. i always get a lot of compliments when i wear it.\n",
      "I just had to try it on because it was so soft! and i have never felt so comfortable and so sexy at the same time in a dress! i am 5'4 170lbs and 36ddd and the large fit well. i only with the slit came up higher. that might be an issue just because of my height though. loved it, waiting for a good sale!!\n",
      "This dress is so soft! the dress hangs really well across the front and hides your stomach area a bit. you can wear a regular bra with this dress as well. \r\n",
      "the downside to this dress is that is shows the slightest liquid and stains very easily. wore this on a hot day and the slightest sweat showed. in addition, the front drape across the chest can gape open and show your bra. \r\n",
      "overall, i really love the fit of this dress.\n",
      "The fit on this jean is amazing, they just run large, and then they also stretch quite a bit after 1-2 wears. i am usually a solid size 30 (and have other pairs of dl1961s) but i am buying in a 28 - so i would say one or two sizes down from your usual size.\n",
      "Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas, the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body, but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.\n",
      "The flower print really caught my eye. i like the unique twisted neckline. there is a lot of material here, but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops.\n",
      "This dress is amazing. based upon its rack appearance i never would have tried this dress on but the fabric was irresistibly soft so i gave it a try. i was amazed to see it fit so well. i'm very curvy (125lbs, 5'4\", 32dd ) so normally a dress without structure doesn't work on me but this one somehow does. the elastic waist hits right at the smallest part of my waist (i'm very short waisted if that helps) and flows from there beautifully. i think the v-cut at the chest area help reduce the appear\n",
      "I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shirt is so cute. it's so soft, love the lace element on the arm. definitely thinking of ordering the white. the back for me is a lot longer then the pic shows but i think it looks good.\n",
      "I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.\n",
      "This top is very pretty, but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small, which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can\n",
      "I saw this jacket on the sale rack at my local store but the size was extra small, and needed a medium. the store was able to order since it showed back order . i do miss the charge send option, but still love retailer! normally i wear a medium in this brand. i received my order today and it's a beautiful jacket however there's a few things that could have been done in the manufacture that would've improved it. one, the jacket is not lined and it would be beneficial if the jacket was lined or even\n",
      "I wasn't sure about this top when i saw it on line but it is actually nicer than the picture. it is very flattering and the color is perfect for the summer!\n",
      "I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4\", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend.\n",
      "I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.\n",
      "I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.\n",
      "Just agreeing with all the good reviews.  love the color, feel, fit and versatility.  you can look sexy or modest depending on your underpinnings and accessories.  drapes over and disguises my figure flaws.  this is a three season dress for me and i look forward to having this in my rotation in the years to come.  i bought regular hem instead of petite.\n",
      "I bought the tiny brand \"cassia\" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this \"sorcha\" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.\n",
      "My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8\", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!\n",
      "I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.\n",
      "I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!\n",
      "This is the best ever t-shirt i've ever worn. feels so soft! looks gorgeous! very comfortable and yet has that bit of sparkle that makes it perfect for a special evening with friends etc! just love the fit- it makes me look slimmer:)\n",
      "Great length if over 5'5\". ran at least 1-2 sizes smaller. great wash\n",
      "I was pleased with the fabric and lace, and the arms fit me nicely. the only problem was that the bottom of the sweater was very boxy and not flattering. i am having the sides taken in to fix.\n",
      "I was happy to receive this sweater in no time at all. when i opened the package it seemed too thin, however, after trying it on, it's the perfect fit and style. can be worn with jeans or skirts and even dress slacks. great buy.\n",
      "I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!\n",
      "I was surprised i was the 1st to review this t- i got it on black friday & loved the fit and look immediately! i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or ... many options and a good price!\n",
      "I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down, and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering, fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long\n",
      "I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!\n",

      "I purchased this sweater in my usual xs, but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff, too, so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also, the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small, but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou\n",
      "This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11\" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.\n",
      "The first reviewer was right about this dress--checked her review before buying it. it's a beautiful creation and perfectly designed, and it's also slimming. i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt, but it is fine. highly recommended.\n",
      "I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik\n",
      "It's really a casual tee, but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color, it can have a little more dressed to go out look. i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture, but has a nice flattering flow. a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale.\n",
      "Fits great, not too tight/baggy. pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own.\n",
      "I thought i'd add a review because a lot of this landscape-print tee was still available at my local durham, nc store (the week after xmas anyway). it's a little different in person than how it appeared online (when it was still available). the white cotton is definitely a cream or off-white. and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown. the metallic is a subtle gold. it's definitely 3/4 sleeves, which i like and it has a curved bottom hem. the surprise to me was that it\n",
      "This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2\", 102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!\n",
      "I wish we had cooler weather in california so i could wear this more often. i bought this sweater/coat on sale plus an extra 20% off so i got a great deal on it. i love this sweater! it looks matronly in the picture but it looks very chic and sophisticated in person. the sleeves hit above the wrist as shown on the model. it does have pockets. it's the right weight for chilly weather.\n",
      "This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4\", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!\n",
      "I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2\", 109lbs)\n",
      "I got this tee for a great price online and i did like it a lot. i got it in medium and i might have liked it better if it was just a bit bigger or if the material wasn't quite so clingy. i decided it had to go back.\n",
      "A great skinny jean, these grey beauties are flattering and light weight. they fit true to size, but seems a bit on the long side, bunching oddly at the ankle when wearing them with booties. hopefully they hold up to some heavy wear.\n",

      "Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.\n",
      "I didn't even notice this tee online, but in person in the store, i instantly loved it. then trying it on, loved it even more. it is flattering without being too tight. i got an xs, which is my usual size. i'm not a huge fan of the 3/4 sleeve length in winter, so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve, but no biggie, i still love!\n",
      "Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!\n",

      "I probably wouldn't have even tried this on in the store, but i took a chance when it was on sale. i put it on and it was immediate love. the fit is perfect. i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large. it is not boxy, but not too tight either. it feels well made.\n",
      "So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.\n",
      "Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.\n",
      "I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.\n",
      "Ok, if i had a different body, this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage), it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me, this isn't the jumpsuit for you. \r\n",

      "I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.\n",

      "i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.\n",
      "I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size, and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.\n",
      "This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.\n",
      "In the photo, this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7, always take a size medium but on me, the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button, it stretches and looks terrible. in the back, it falls short. it's going back.\n",
      "This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.\n",
      "As soon as i opened the package, i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5\" and 128lb, ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3\n",
      "I popped into retailer the other day just to look around, and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first, then i saw the cut and style, and fell in love! they only had xs and s, and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous, i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely, and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large, but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very \"peasant princess\" feel to\n",

      "So many things to love about this top. if you're a fan of peplum tops - which i most definitely am - this is a great one. slightly shorter in front than in back. nice flare, but doesn't stick out too far. and overall, i thought it was well-made. i tried on the red in stores, and it looks a lot like the color in the photo. however, i'm a 36dd, and unfortunately, the top was just not large enough. totally squashed the girls, and there's basically no give in the fabric. i'm normally a 10/12, and ot\n",
      "This dress looked very flattering on me, i say true to size to slightly small. as mentioned in title, the zipper ended up opening in the middle near where the waist is. the lace is soft and fits comfortably, the waist band is the tighter fit. the skirt is less see-through in the store anyway. darker red in person (overall). hoping the one i tired on was a fluke. the skirt has a bit of pleating to it, or atl east it looks like it...\r\n",

      "This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size 1 and i love the fit.\n",
      "I did like this top, but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great, the fabric is amazing, but it just didn't fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size, but i just wasn't sure that i would wear it a lot.\n",

      "This skirt is flattering and so soft. i've worn it once, and while it did keep feeling like a scandalous slit, i just had to keep reminding myself of the awesome inner skirt. i gave a 4 instead of 5 because my elastic seems to roll ever so slightly in front so that the pleats don't hang flat, and also a little bit of stitching on the outside was loose. since it's nothing that will unravel the whole thing, i'm not too worried about it.\n",

      "I agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large. i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however, the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely. i'm 5'8\" but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress. the dress is a very dark forest green (not black). see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that, due to the material, it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t\n",
      "Material is too thin and quality is poor\n",

      "The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through, just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.\n",
      "The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.\n",
      "This dress is lovely. the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model; otherwise, looks very similar to photo. it has a slimline style and is very flattering. the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo. its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress, notwithstanding another reviewer's opinion to the contrary.\n",

      "Recently, i have been so wanting to get a lightwash denim jacket and i found the piece right here! i love that its cropped and so easy to wear. its not stiff at all and sized right. i got an xs my normal size and its so comfy and surprisingly soft. \r\n",

      "I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went.\n",
      "I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however, when i tried it on, i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck, arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy, although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me, but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so, it may be best to wear a cami\n",
      "Dress is comfortable, feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute, fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4\", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.\n",

      "So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle, bressay, this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model, but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color, the warmth, the neckline, and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats\n",
      "This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.\n",
      "Super cute version of your standard chambray shirt. i'll be adding more of my own patches to this one!\n",
      "I am 5 '4\", 124lbs, and 36 c - usually take a small or sometimes a medium in t.la tops. this top seems to run particularly large as i ended up with an xs.\n",
      "This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.\n",
      "I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.\n",
      "I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft, very good quality, fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!\n",
      "I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!\n",
      "This dress has really great features--the style is adorable, and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.\n",
      "Loved this sweater but too boxy\n",
      "I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6\" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.\n",
      "I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it's a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!\n",
      "Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!\n",
      "I agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin, and it would make a far better swimsuit cover-up or pajamas than an actual dress -- unless you don't mind that it is semi see-thru. however, that said, i do love it! it is soft, the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty, and it is flattering -- as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move (so no bread and pasta). i have worn it a couple of times already, and i have received compliments on\n",
      "Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.\n",
      "I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a \"day dress\"--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t\n",
      "This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!\n",
      "Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin, so it works as a swim cover, but definitely not a dress for anything else.\n",
      "Would have loved this skirt, but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!\n",
      "Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also, 100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny, you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.\n",
      "I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ\n",
      "This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.\n",
      "Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.\n",
      "Although the fabric and color is beautiful,  the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.\n",
      "Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!\n",
      "This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace, substantial fabric, great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders, and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model, they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned, the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4\", 120 lbs, and tried a size s.\n",

      "Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.\n",
      "I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.\r\n",

      "T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.\n",

      "Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.\n",
      "This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.\n",
      "Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.\n",
      "I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.\n",
      "This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.\n",

      "The colors on this are beautiful! i have wider hips and thighs and this blouse just looks too boxy on me. i ordered a size down and from that aspect it fit. however, it is too flowy and boxy for my body type. i considered keeping it for layering but even on sale, it is too expensive for this purpose. i'm so bummed because the colors are so pretty!\n",

      "This seems to be designed to fit a bit loose, but not in a bad way (for me). the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute, and i think this can look good with or without a belt. light for summer but still covers a lot, which is nice for the office. the sleeves are a little short, but it doesn't look bad. glad i snatched it.\n",

      "This is such a fun version of a v-neck tshirt. the lines and seams are very flattering, the neckline is perfect. i'm 5'10\" a size 10/12 (depending) and i ordered the medium in the navy which fit perfectly. the length was slightly shorter on me than the model. overall a great shirt. highly recommended.\n",
      "Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large, so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized, but i love that look, and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b, 126 lbs, 5'10\"\n",

      "This is gorgeous! i absolutely love it but i need to return it. this is the second time i've ordered this dress/tunic. the fit is amazing, the fabric is so soft and it looks so fabulous on. the issue that i've had twice is that the back of the dress was not cut in the same direction. this means the sheen is different on one side of the middle seam in the back than the other side. unfortunately, it looks like 2 different colors. i returned the first one and i reordered but i have the same thing a\n",

      "I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq\n",
      "I love the details of this top: the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering, especially if you have a tummy. the arm holes aren't gaping like so many tops, so you don't even need a cami underneath to hide your bra. it is a bit on the larger side. i often wear a large, but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small.\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!\n",
      "Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3\" and 115 lbs. i ordered an xs. it hits at my knees and is not see through. the color is pinkish in person which i like more than the photo.\n",
      "The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a \"swing\" top. i am 5'9\" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.\n",
      "I absolutely love this top.....the color, style, fit..everything! i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium. i have had so many compliments wearing this top. it is very feminine, flows nicely, hangs well. love the color. can't recommend this enough!\n",
      "Love this casual and soft flowing top. its a nice loose fit. slightly big, however i'm petite. asymmetrical hem adds a unique touch. pairs well with a variety of denim skinnies...black, dark denim. planning to try with white ankle skinnies as well. the v-neck is just right. dips enough to show the neckline without revealing cleavage. it's the perfect lightweight layer for spring to fall. i even added a black blazer for a cool evening out. love this top and would buy in other colors.\n",
      "I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go.\r\n",

      "This dress fits and hangs so nicely. it is so versatile as well. dress it up or down!\n",
      "Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3\" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one, however.\n",
      "I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year, i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently, try them on. the dress is worth the price.\n",
      "This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large\n",
      "I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i wouldn't spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesn't make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!\n",
      "I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.\n",
      "The photos don't do the top of the dress justice; it's really gorgeous. however, it runs very large. i am going to exchange it for 1 or 2 sizes down.\n",
      "Love this. bought the cream in store and the burgundy online. perfect alone or to wear under an retailer sweater.\n",

      "I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ\n",
      "I saw this in the store in blue and loved it. wore it and received lots of compliments. just bought the second color online as there is free shipping today. great dress for work as the weather is warming up.\n",
      "Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.\n",
      "Wonderful and comfortable dress, very sweet.\n",
      "I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.\n",
      "I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect. i am 5'3\" and 110 pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great. the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me! it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties :) overall, i recommend this dress!!\n",
      "This is the perfect little throw-on dress. flattering, uber-comfortable, nice fabric. i found that it runs slightly large.\n",
      "So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :)\n",
      "This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5\", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2\" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.\n",
      "I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.\n",

      "I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine, whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short, as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh\n",

      "\n",
      "The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn't look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it.\n",

      "Cool cut and texture a winner\n",
      "It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.\n",

      "This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7\",125lbs and the small fit.\n",
      "Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.\n",

      "I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t\n",

      "I loved this romper so much! the material is thin, but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy, like on the model, to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.\n",
      "I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale, and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering, i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs, 34d, and the size 6 fit perfectly!\n",
      "This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.\n",

      "Beautiful crepey fabric, lovely color. i was surprised to see gold threading in the peach option; i'm not a big gold thread fan, but it's do-able. the ruching across the back makes the fit very loose and blousy. this is not a figure-defining piece. but it's comfortable (will probably be more so after a wash to get that stiffy factory fabric finish feeling out), and versatile.\n",
      "Love, love this dress! the fit is perfect, the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare. there is the perfect amount of swing and it's a great length, i can't say enough about it. i think it's worth the price, which i have to admit, i was hesitant about. so comfortable and versatile! i see it being worn quite often!\r\n",

      "I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them \"wine, side zip pants.\" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.\n",

      "I ordered this on line. pretty, but ran large so returning. i am 5'10\" and 140lbs., not large chested, and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft, loose, knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.\n",
      "I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it, but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon, because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.\n",

      "perfect fit and very good quality.\n",
      "I love this dress. wearing it is the equivalent as wearing your coziest t-shirt. there is stretch up top if your chest needs it, the neckline is modest, the stripes and geometric pattern are flattering and vibrant, but not gaudy in the slightest. the length is perfect with the shortest part at my knee. silhouette is tight at the natural waist and flares out in the most flowy and flattering way. i got the large. i am 5'7\" and fluctuate between 170 -185 lbs.\n",

      "I love lightweight coat-jackets, of which this is a great example. they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples. the unstructured linen, while indeed lined, gives this coat a casual drape for spring/summer. i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t, with chambray or white linen pants, even as a chic beach cover-up. i un-tacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look, but it's decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear. fu\n",

      "I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....\n",
      "When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?\n",
      "I usually wear a 27 in ag and other designer jeans. i ordered a 29 based on the other reviewers. they fit like the model and look great. i might have been able to go with 28 if these end up stretching out, so i'm hoping they don't. they are nice and thick for white jeans, yet soft and comfy.\n",

      "Bought this in navy. needed something comfortable, but able to dress up denim. this was perfect! wore it already and immediately got 2 complements. the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large. bought in medium. i'm 5'8\" and 145 lbs. just washed it for first time. noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front. may have to steam to get wrinkles out, but still worth it.\n",
      "I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well, in my usual 4 petite, i think it would look nice on some people, as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.\n",
      "The design looked super cute online, but in person, the material seemed cheap. actually, at least in the green one, the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material, it would have been much nicer.\n",
      "I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult, but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.\n",
      "I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!\n",
      "Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.\n",
      "Due to the prior review, this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.\n",
      "This dress is so flattering and comfortable. i bought it in xs and it fits perfectly. i'm 5'7\" and weigh 135 - i usually wear a small but the small would have been too roomy on top. i got so many compliments on the dress (in blue) that i ordered it in green as well! perfect combination of comfort, style and flattering fit.\n",
      "I got this dress in green and it looks better in person than it even does in the online picture. the fabric is soft and flattering. i am pear shaped so a lot of things don't look good around my waist, but this worked beautifully. the only thing is that i can't get the slight wrinkles out of the bottom. i washed it and lined dried it and some still show. the care says not to iron. a steamer would probably work well on this. the slight wrinkles are not an issue for me though. well worth it and a g\n",
      "I love these pants, they are soft versatile and stylish! great choice!\n",
      "This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot), so i would have liked to size down; however, the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms, maybe you could size down and make this work.\n",
      "I liked these as soon as i saw them. the are very comfortable and the fit is great. well constructed and the material is soft but thicker.. easily worn into the cooler days. i am so happy i made this purchase!\n",
      "This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.\n",
      "This dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet- it's so easy to pull on, but adding a nice pair of shoes, a piece of jewelry, and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time. i must admit, my local store didn't stock this dress so i wasn't quite expecting the texture of the fabric (i was expecting it to be smooth but it's almost ribbed?). it's soft and comfortable though, so that's certainly not a deal breaker. i only wish they'd had it in petite as i feel t\n",
      "Love the nautical vibe, perfect for summer wear. the knit top with cap sleeves is easy to wear and not clingy for those with limps and bumps. the asymmetrical skirt has a flare which again makes this dress easy and comfortable to wear.  i'm usually a size 8, 36-29-40 and the medium fit my hourglass shape perfectly.\n",
      "Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6\" and the length hits just below\n",
      "Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket.\n",
      "Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute\n",
      "I purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store. it is cozy and stylish-love the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck. i am 5'7\" and 135 lbs and the s fit great. noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now! it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant, all the better, right??\n",
      "I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders, larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.\n",
      "I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.\n",
      "I like the grey pattern and black and white contrast versions the best! very soft and falls nicely on my bust. the biggest differences wit the sizes are on length, so i ordered up for it would be a bit longer. it's a great piece.\n",
      "It's hard for me to find dresses that look good on me since i have more of a straight build and tend to carry a little extra weight in my middle. however, this dress was super flattering, giving me some curves and hiding my tummy. i got the one with the red skirt (it's definitely an orange-red) since that looked a little more polished and less casual than the green one i tried on in the store. the full, fluttery skirt is feminine and fun, and the knit top is very soft and comfortable. every sing\n",
      "Based on the other reviews, i ordered a l and xl even though i would normally order a m. the l fits like a slightly fitted m without being too tight; the xl, of course, is a little larger, but not like a typical xl, certainly not sloppy-looking or oversized. the material is soft and the dark blue is lovely. i will be keeping both sizes. i would most likely not have been happy with a m.\n",
      "I ordered a medium in these, and they were *just* too small for me. i'm a 12, so i was pushing it. there is no room for thighs.. :( but the material is great and the styling is fun. the length seemed ok for me, too.

      "I ordered the geometric, blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately, it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting, bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference, i'm 5'4\" 120lbs 34 a.\n",

      "I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.\n",
      "These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.\n",
      "Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!\n",
      "First of all, the colors are really pretty, fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested, this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid, it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.\n",
      "Great looking casual dress, but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice, clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with\n",
      "This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way, did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric, go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.\n",
      "This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.\n",
      "Love these wide-leg chinos. they are super comfy and the fabric is incredibly soft. the size fit true for me. i would buy these again.\n",
      "Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !\n",
      "I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6\", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to\n",

      "like the other reviewers, i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm, yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out, so buy now if you want it.\n",
      "This is a well made sweater. i sometimes have a problem with wool but this is as soft as cashmere and does not itch at all. the color is beautiful and will work with gray,black,tan and navy. i found this to run a little bit on the large side. i am between a size large and extra large and ordered the extra large. there is too much fabric on the sides and the peplum starts at an awkward spot, mid hip instead of waistline. i think that sizing down to a large will solve these problems. it is really\n",
      "Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly, it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything, yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's), but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i\n",
      "Tried this on in the store, very soft and hangs well, better on, than the hanger. needless to say i bought it!\n",
      "Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.\n",
      "The teal color is beautiful. the fit is wide leg with a low waist. i have been wearing so many high waist pieces lately they felt really low. the material is really soft. they fit tts.\n",
      "Love these! the raw hem is on-trend! length is great (i'm 5'6\"). material is the classic pilcro washed chinos. perfect. as with all pilcro pants, they stretch a bit. :)\n",
      "Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4\", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!\n",
      "I got this dress in a petite xs. i'm 5'4\" and 110lbs. it fit just right. i usually wear a regularl xs in most brands, but with retailer, i noticed i always have to go to the petittes. anyway, the dress is super cute. love the diagonal striping and the draping is not too poofy which is great. the material is very lightweight on the bottom - which is good for spring/summer.\n",
      "This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!\n",
      "This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.\n",
      "This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p\n",
      "I absolutely love this jacket! it is the softest jacket i own. the collar takes this to the next level. i wasn't sure i would like the collar but after trying it on, i love it. i'm so confused as to why the pockets are partially sewn together. it's weird but according to the other reviews, i am hoping to open the pockets up completely. i really should have gotten a medium in this coat. i am usually between a small and medium and this is a little on the smaller side. i bought this one on sale so\n",

      "Beautiful dress! perfect for work, the museum, a summer picnic...so chic, yet extremely comfortable. i purchased the blue/orange combo and the colors definitely pop. for reference i am 5'2, 115, and i went with the xs petite. especially reoommend for anyone with her hourglass being more full on bottom. super flattering!\n",
      "I am a solid 14 and the size l fit nicely. it's easy to wear. the diagonal print is quite flattering. my husband liked it. i am 5'9\" and it was a bit short, but not too short. i've not washed it yet so can't say how that will go. the fabric is knit but does not look like it will pill.\n",
      "I was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store. i'm normally a size 2 but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms, so found a size 4 to be just right. it's longer and a bit wider than the size 2 everywhere else, but given the design, i thought it was fine. the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever. if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders, sizing up is a must. lengthwise, it fit me like it does on the model.

      "I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr\n",
      "I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute, but missed the mark.\n",
      "This is a really cute top. yes, it is dry clean only but i plan on hand washing it. one negative is that it is extremely short in length. i'm 5 feet tall and this top barely goes past my bellybutton. it's extremely soft though and definitely different.\n",
      "Cute dress, runs small, especially in the sleeves and chest (i usually wear a 0 and purchased a 2). the outer layer is very sheer and while the print and shape are cute, the quality could be better, especially for the price.\n",
      "Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.\r\n",
      "on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.\n",
      "This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim, & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms, and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light, but i love in so cal, so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies, heeled clogs, and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and the 8 fits perfectly.\n",
      "I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it, though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems. \r\n",
      "1- it was to short. i am 5'8\" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it. \r\n",
      "2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently, so perhaps i've gone down a size, but the medium was like a sack on me. \r\n",
      "3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical. \r\n",
      "4- as others have noted,\n",
      "For the price, you can't beat this dress. i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it - if you're a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts (like the tearoom pencil skirt), you will love this! for me, it's the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it. it's a perfect length (above the knee on 5\"7\"...similar to the model), armholes are the right size, and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering, even post-baby. super happy with the value\n",
      "I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering, super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.\n",
      "Listed on the package labeling but not in the product description. i am short in the waist and this is still much shorter than pictured. disappointed to send this one back as it's otherwise perfect.\n",
      "This is awesome multi-season dress.\n",

      "The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn't wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf\n",

      "I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!\n",
      "This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear, though.\n",
      "Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.\n",
      "I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and 3 different women at whole foods complimented my sweater. it is soft and warm. would love in other colors too...like a mint green.\n",
      "I bought this to wear to my winter bridal shower. it was a cold day so i turned it into a jumper by pairing it with a silk blouse. it is flattering and comfortable. great for work and other semi-formal events.\n",
      "This tank is super soft and very well fitted. it fits true to size. the lace is so pretty in front but what makes this unique is the lace on the back of the top. it is a unique design and good quality!\n",
      "I think this dress is adorable . it fits great. wear it with heels or cowboy boots. you will not be disappointed\n",
      "Tried this dress on in the store and could barely button at my chest but the waist and length were perfect. ordered a size up and two sizes up online. went with the two sizes up because it did not pull as bad across the chest, though now it's a bit \"blousey\" around the waste. fabric is a little thin. similar to other reviews the slip is a little weird/wonky. i'm keeping it because i like the idea of the dress but i'm not sure about the lifespan with how gauzy the material is.\n",
      "This is a great sweater to wear out over a top or instead of a jacket.the yarn used is super soft and warm. i typically wear a size medium in sweaters and tops and ordered a size medium. it fits perfectly!\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.\n",
      "Easy to wear, get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down\n",
      "This is very cute and well-made, but unfortunately for my coloring and hair, washed me out a bit. the attention to detail is fabulous and it is a great layering piece for spring. tts but definitely longer as is shown in picture on model.\n",
      "This dress is adorable, but it unfortunately didn't work for me. i agree with the reviews that stated the fabric is very heavy\n",
      "The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi, jacket, sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1\", 115lbs, i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t\n",
      "The top is a pretty design. it's a low v-neck. but it would be nice for layering. it was just way to tight. runs small. order up a size.\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad - it just didn't work for me. i am 5'2\", 138 pounds (still trying to lose that last 5-8 from my third daughter) and the chest/back of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back. i am normally a size 6 and tried the 6 p, 8 p and 8 and they were all too tight in the chest/back. it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses. :(\n",
      "This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also, it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty, and if you purchase it for that, then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.\n",
      "This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer\n",
      "I love the style of this dress, comfortable but chic, and it feels great!\n",
      "When i first saw this dress, it honestly didn't catch my eye, but as i kept seeing it in on the catalog and other places on pinterest, i realized how unique this dress is. i looked at the reviews and was surprised at how negative the comments were- i'm the type of lady who gets stuck on something and won't get off of it until i try it for myself. so, i ordered it on sale and i love it! it isn't flannel material, and so i wasn't expecting this to be a dress that would keep me warm by itself- but\n",
      "Scratchy, wide cut = not flattering, i tried to make this work because i wanted a different, unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either.., it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!\n",
      "This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.\n",
      "I ordered a size small. i am 5'7\" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.\n",
      "This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5\", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long\n",
      "Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!\n",
      "Dress runs a little small in the arms but flows nicely on the body. see through and comes with slip but slip is stiff and doesn't give. was hard to get on so i wore my own slip. other that that, dress is feminine and looks great on!\n",
      "I love this duster! i got my usual size and it fits exactly as pictured. the color of the fabric is a perfect neutral and will look good with anything. the knit is open and fairly see-through, this avoids the bathrobe look that a long length sweater can have. bought at full price and i'm not sorry because i bet it will be gone before long!\n",
      "This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!\n",
      "These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.\r\n",

      "why don\"t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!\n",
      "I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!\n",
      "I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris, because i purchased this shirt in carmel, ca and it is actually maeve, which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well. this piece did not disappoint. this is a fun and versatile black top, but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it. i don't find the fabric to be \"rough\" at all, but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece. i am a 34d and did not find my c\n",
      "I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric, like the main photo shown, you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.\n",
      "I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice, light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification, however, it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist, larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips, but does very little to show off my waist. overall, it is just ok.\n",
      "I've been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner! flattering fit, comfy quality fabric...makes me feel great even right after having a baby. fits tts and i can't wait to rock this beauty!\n",

      "This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.\n",
      "Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.\n",
      "I should preface this by saying that i'm in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i'm keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style, but i wouldn't be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds!\n",
      "I love the style the lightness and the fit ... but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations. this might be something to find at a mass retailer. i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric.\n",
      "I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived, however, they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly, the pants are, in actuality, quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height, if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly, the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown, although the width of the pant legs may have\n",
      "I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2\" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.\r\n",

      "I saw this today and decided to try it on, it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e, and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable, no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees, i'm ready to wear this.\n",
      "The raspberry color is really stunning! i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors. i was thrilled when i saw these! i've worn them once so far. very comfortable and seem like they will last.\n",
      "I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3\" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs, not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got \"lost in the sauce\". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though.\n",
      "Love the bright red color. such a comfortable fit, but still feminine and pretty. could be dressed up or down. will definitely be a summer favorite.\n",
      "Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love\n",
      "I loved this tunic. dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties. i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans.\n",

      "I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.\n",
      "What?! i can't believe this got so many mixed reviews! i wasn't sure what to expect and now that i've received it, i think it's absolutely perfect. it's flattering, the length is great, it's tts, and the color is beautiful. i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either.  i'm really pleased with this purchase and i can't wait to wear it.\n",

      "This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,\n",
      "I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.\n",
      "I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins, and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!\n",
      "I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.\n",
      "I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set, but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly, i returned the set.\n",
      "I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body, however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve\n",
      "I love pilcro script jeans. the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight. the wash is great. from the pictures, i didn't realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem, but they cuff easily if you want to hide it. plus, with boot season approaching, i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem. i wish they would make this cut with all of their products - would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants!\n",

      "Casual, pretty. runs a little large, especially through the waist, but a great comfortable shirt.\n",
      "Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.\n",
      "This says online only, hwoever the balc one was in my store (and some other colros too). anyway, i actually liked this top, it is more flattering than the model shows, i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos. on me, the regualr size is almost a dress (should i be younger), but i do like that (i did debate ordering petite, and decided not to). it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors, and sublte stripes on the black version.\n",

      "I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly, the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo\n",

      "I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that, so i ordered this one. fit is very similar. this one is made of a lightweight cotton, and has a similar cut. will be a great fall transitional jacket, and looks great with lots of things--maxi skirts, skinny jeans, long tops with the hems peaking out, etc. i found it tts: i got an xs and am 5'4\", 120 lbs. i don't plan to wear more than a thin top underneath, but don't think i could fit a sweater under the sle\n",
      "I like this comfy top. i bought it to wear with a cute pair of gold charlie cropped pants i bought from retailer last fall. the only thing i don't like is the odd length of the sleeves. they are somewhere between elbow and 3/4. i am a true xxsp in most tops, but the sleeves end right at my elbow making it difficult to wear them unrolled. for reference i am 5'1\" and 107 lbs. a larger size would have been too wide and roomy. overall, i am happy with my purchase.\n",
      "The pattern \"camouflages\" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft, great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out.\n",
      "This skirt ran short, small, and boxy. if you can get the right fit, the skirt is great quality and super cute, but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.\n",
      "I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8\" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.\n",

      "This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops, but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere, but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area, so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton, so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath, and i can't see m\n",
      "Was excited to receive this top in the mail, and wasn't disappointed when i tried it on. beautiful colors (true to image) and pattern -the blue back does extend into the front, but does not look unflattering in the least or leave for an awkward fit, imho. very happy with this top, it looks so cute from the back, too~\n",
      "\n",
      "This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.\n",
      "The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy, but they just looked sloppy. also, the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft, but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.\n",
      "I bought these in the store today. they're a great jean. none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture. there were no holes, which i'm actually grateful for, i don't like holes in jeans. anyway these had a great fit for me. they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside- they aren't baggy, as pictured on the model. they're a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple! (even better- my husband gave them a big thumbs up!)\n",
      "I ordered this online, but i own the vest and i love it, so i took a chance. this is a super comfy, great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color, i ordered the green, is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that, you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended\n",
      "I've been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect! it's super soft and comfortable. will look awesome over a dress or with jeans. love it!\n",
      "This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose, but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.\n",

      "This is a great casual skirt for summer, color pairs well with many tops.\n",
      "This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6\" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.\r\n",
      "i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.\r\n",

      "This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!), so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.\n",
      "The neutral color was at my local retailer, which is a rich brown/mocha, much nicer looking in person. like others, this is quite sheer and thin. however, it is so stretchy, breathable, and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead. for my 5'9\", 36c, hourglass frame, i found the medium to be rather body hugging. it was not at all loose like on the model. for me, this is fine because i will layer, eliminating issues of sheerness.\n",
      "This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.\n",
      "This is a great jacket for fall layering. love the color and cut. it wasn't appearing to me in the photo that the sleeves were knit, but it actually works. i wear the sleeves pushed up as i have really long arms and they are a smidge short. now my go too for casual work days and weekend wear.\n",

      "This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know, it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my\n",

      "I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4\" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.\n",
      "I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.\n",

      "I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7\" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!\n",
      "I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.\r\n",

      "I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in.\n",

      "This was way better than i expected it to be. tts and flattering. the material on the top section is on the thinner side, but is very soft and comfortable. the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me, but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work.\n",
      "Cute and comfy. looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too. fabric and fit are great!\n",
      "Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.\n",
      "I ordered a large, and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me, it was not. it ran a little small on top, buttons bulged at my chest, and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some, just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.\n",
      "I can't decide on these pants. after trying them on in the store, they are very soft and a beautiful blue color. however, i found them a bit small. i usually take a l in retailer pants, and these are very tight. probably could pull them off with a tunic top, however, in spite of the fabric, the fit was just not comfortable for me. a good alternative for denim if you are slender, rather than curvy.\n",
      "This dress is so cute but it definitely is highly as other reviewers have stated.\n",
      "What a great find! this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric. the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but it's a versatile piece otherwise. the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch.\n",

      "At 5'3\" and 155 pounds with a short waist, it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable, very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 32 so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these, you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.\n",

      "When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(\n",
      "I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4\" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall, or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!\n",

      "I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.\n",
      "I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall, so i bought it a size smaller than normal, but it fits, so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy, and it kind of camouflaged that, which is always great!\n",
      "This \"little\" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt, but that only adds to the appeal, and is well done, not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece.\n",
      "This dress is so pretty, comfortable and easy to wear. i got so many compliments in it. it is a winner for sure!\n",
      "Love this top!\n",
      "Soft, comfortable, flattering - great for spring, summer, fall, and wear a tight black long-sleeved tee underneath for winter! not form-fitting, even if you size down.\n",
      "Very nice but thin materal. very sheer. i paired with the palmarosa wide legs. loved the way it looked. i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt, though.\n",
      "I got this before the winter. so i could wear it for summer and fall. it is light wave material for summer and fall. i think it would be good for spring time too.the color of this pants is more natural so it is easy to march any color of tops.i really enjoy it.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.\n",
      "I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w\n",
      "Wonderful dress! very comfortable and great fit! received numerous compliments whenever i wear it.\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.\n",
      "I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also, the fit is loose, maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.\n",
      "This dress is so soft and comfortable. great winter staple. i purchased the blue motif, which really doesn't have any blue on it. the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable.\n",
      "I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.\n",
      "I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!\n",
      "This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4\", i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size, not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!\n",
      "Casual comfort with style! fabric is a dream to wear and it flows nicely. not exactly form-fitting, but still flattering. i'm 5'9, 140, and wore the medium.\n",
      "The fabric is super soft and litght. it hardly feels like you are wearing it. body skimming fit can disguise a less than perfect figure. can easily go from day to night. absolutely love.\n",
      "This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on, it fit great on my arms, wasn't too tight on my neck, but once it went down over my chest (36c), the dress never came back \"in\" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me, very disappointing! similar to a mumu.\n",
      "I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!\n",
      "Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.\n",
      "I bought the multi-color stripe and it is adorable! i am 5'9\", 135 lbs and purchased a size small. it is a perfect length and drapes well...not too tight at all. i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it. highly recommend!\n",
      "I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol\n",
      "I took a chance buying online. i'm thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.\n",
      "I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it's trendy without trying too hard. nice lines, the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty, i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.\n",
      "I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room, the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co\n",
      "Love this dress!! i layer spanx and a seamless tank underneath, as the fabric would show everything if worn on it's own.\n",
      "In general, if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress, you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale, but it's a pass for now.\n",
      "The price is amazing for this easy and flattering dress. looks great as is or with a scarf, sweater, jacket, you name it! i just couldn't resist getting carried away with this one..\n",
      "I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.\n",
      "I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa\n",
      "Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.\n",
      "Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w\n",
      "I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7\" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any \"problem\" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!\n",
      "I saw this online and wasnt sure and actually walked right past it in the store. but my usual stylist walked around the store with me and insisted it was a goodone. she usually knows what she is talking about... super soft nd comfortable, love the long sleeves (it has hidden buttons), cut is flattering on everyone. i ended up ordering petite size. turtleneck is not too tight, and the dress can pretty mjuch be dressed up or down. my friend also bought it (huhm twinsies)!! my favorite design was t\n",
      "Great, stylish, swinging dress. softly draped fabric, so comfy to wear....very slimming and figure flattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this dress (i bought the navy with white stripes). it is comfortable, flattering, and versatile. best of all, i received a complement from my husband, who never comments on my clothing! the drapey knit fabric fits closely (but not tightly) in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body. the fabric is soft and stretchy, not too thick, but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath (i am 5'4\", 123 lbs). i wore this to a christmas party and\n",
      "I bought this dress at the sale and love it! very retro inspired and pretty. however, because of the placement of the zipper with the ribbons, it's hard to zip up. i had to size up to a 12 for this problem alone.\n",
      "I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.\n",
      "Love this dress - \"swingy\" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down.\n",
      "I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress.....the reviews were great, the price was right and i needed a simple black dress. the fabric (jersey) is lovely and drapes nicely and the print was pretty. unfortunately, the armholes were way too long and low for me and even with a black bra, i was sharing more of my lingerie than i wanted. perhaps someone with a slightly smaller chest could size down and avoid oversharing!\r\n",
      "for reference, i am 5'5\", 145 and wear a 30gg bra. i ordered the m.\n",
      "This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!\n",
      "I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o\n",
      "Love that this is comfy, with a subtle yet sexy vibe. had so many compliments when i wore this to work, with everyone asking where i got it! fits true to size (110lb, 5'4\") and xs fit perfect. took off a star because it may look like it could get that \"fuzzy\" pilling over time.\n",
      "This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!\n",
      "My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!\n",
      "I love this dress! the design is simple, colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy, no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously, it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns, i will just buy them blindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe\n",
      "This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape, and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint, and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating, is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating, but not enough that i won't keep the dress.\n",
      "Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5\" and the dress came to just barely above my k\n",
      "This is a super cute dress which is quite flattering. it is made with a higher waist and a bit of a fit and flare. the only complaint is the side zipper which seems to get caught and not move easily.\n",
      "I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs, i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t\n",
      "This dress is super comfy and really cute! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering, but they didn't make me look larger at all. it's great for casual wear, but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties.\n",
      "Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.\n",
      "This dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful. fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring. hugs all the right places. true to size. i am 5'2 and 120lbs, curvy and the small fit well. i am so happy with this purchase. great price point as well\n",
      "Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online, i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5\"6\", 120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store.\n",
      "First, i absolutely love this dress, and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended, and the dress fits perfectly. however, when i zipped the dress up, the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly, so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.\n",
      "Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline, armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.\r\n",
      "i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo\n",
      "Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a\n",
      "This dress is super comfortable and flattering.  i went with the stripes (and the p to shorten the length) -- it looks amazing with otk boots.  however, the material isn't very thick; it's more of a fall/spring dress than a winter.  i'm a xs-s p in retailer dresses - i went with the small.  xs would've fit but less flatteringly\n",
      "The sleeves are fitted which i love. works with a belt or without.\n",
      "I read the rave reviews, but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6\", 135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today.\n",
      "Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.\n",
      "This dress is comfortable, hugs and skims at all the right places, and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns weren't sold out.\n",
      "Love everything about this dress...cut, color, material and price!\n",
      "This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.\n",
      "A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6\", 32b-24-35.\n",
      "The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!\n",
      "Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.\n",
      "I finally pressed 'go' on the orange dress during the weekend sale. the dress is terrific. i am a busty (36dd) size 8/10 and the m fits perfectly. based on the reviews, i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes, but it is not necessary at all - no bra showing in front or back. i am 5'6\" and the shortest part of the hem is about 2\" above my knee. there is no lining, so i might add a short pull-on slip depending on where i wear it, but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w\n",
      "This dress is so beautiful on. purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down. material is lightweight (perfect for summer) and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine. i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size.\n",
      "I had to order this dress in three different sizes to get it right. i'm 5'6\" and 125, but have a petite frame with curves, so i ordered the small petite; the sleeves and length were too short. then i tried the small regular, and i swam in that one; way too much fabric. the i tried the xs and it fit perfectly. it does stretch around the bust line, so wearing a red bra would look tacky as you can see through the lighter fabric, but black or nude is fine, or even a slip or a tank would cure that is\n",
      "I so wanted to love this little dress, but it just didn't fit my body well. as suggested by others, i ordered a size up, and it did fit. the fabric is stretchy, so there is some give there, but the size zip was a little sticky, because the trim causes a lot of fabric to be bunched along the zipper. the real problem was that the dress was too short-waisted for me. the waist band came right under my chest. maybe this would fit someone with a small-or mid-sized bust better than it did me. i also th\n",
      "I bought this dress for an all white event. i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out! it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better. i am 5'8\" and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s. you must steam out creases before wearing.\n",
      "This is the softest most comfortable dress ever. i bought a large because it was the only one in stock at the store. i'm 5'9, 135 and it's a little loose but still flattering and comfortable due to my height. if you are tall you will not be disappointed w this dress!\n",
      "This is a really cute dress, just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size, however i just did not love it. i am 5'3\" 130#, athletic build, 36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets, which i cannot figure out the purpose, that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress, it bunches out. on my short frame, it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei\n",
      "I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali\n",
      "Finally a dress that is not too short! i'm 5'11 and ordered two sizes. the small was too short and a little snug for my liking. but the medium was a perfect fit.\n",
      "I got so many compliments from friends, i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6\" and a heathy 160 lbs, carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate, it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large.\n",
      "This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7\", and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.\n",
      "I got this in black with white dots. fits great, flattering and helps hide middle section.\n",
      "Tried and bought this in the store! loved it. my normal size 4 worked great. little word to the wise, be careful zipping it up, which is a little tricky. the first one i grabbed had a broken zipper. just takes a little work getting it up bc the fabric is thicker.\n",
      "Love this dress! i bought the blue motif. which barely has any blue at all. it is the softest cotton dress i own. i wore it with my red hunter boots today and it made for the best rainy day ensemble. love, love! and i got it on sale which just sweetens the deal :)\n",
      "If you want it, buy it now. this dress is everything and then some. love it. i bought two, the neutral (black) and the turquoise. the turquoise one is a very retro print, i am getting many compliments. they are so comfortable and flattering. i'm all about this price point retailer. more please!\n",
      "Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall\n",
      "As usual this dress does not disappoint. looks great with boots and is the perfect day to date dress.\n",
      "Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11\", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you.\n",
      "Very comfortable and stylish. can wear with tights, as a dress, or over jeans. cute any way! the material is not super thick, but not too thin.\n",
      "This dress is really lovely. i purchased in the blue green color and think the pattern and ribbon detailing is gorgeous. it runs very small - i am normally a 00p in maeve, and in this dress, due to the length, ended up with a 2 regular. i like my dresses to fit and could have gone with the 0 - it fit well at the waist but was tighter than i prefer across the chest and wanted a more comfortable fit. as other reviewers have noted, it has a higher waist which i think contributes to the sizing issue\n",
      "I bought the dress in navy stripe in december and it became a favorite, so i jumped at the opportunity to buy the \"blue\" (pink/purple/blue/black stripes) when it went on sale. this dress is very flattering and feminine, i love the fitted top, fitted sleeves with a cute button detail, and the asymmetrical hemline. i use the navy for work, whereas the colorful stripey one is fun on the weekends. it washes well and holds shape (i hang it to dry). i like it best with boots, but it would work with fl\n",
      "I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it.  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly!  i am 5'2\", 120# with broad shoulders.  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels.   definitely a keeper!  as a petite gal, this was not overly long.  if you have larger hips, this will not hang well.\n",

      "Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1\" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses.\n",

      "I ordered this dress in the black motif and a petite size. the color is slightly more washed out than depicted probably because of the stretchy fabric used, but it is still nice. the dress does run large. the length is a bit too long and the pockets which i was surprised were even there are several inches too low for my 5'2\" frame. overall though, this will be a good dress for hot summer days and should travel well. i wish the blue, floral one was available when i ordered this dress as it looks\n",

      "Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.\n",

      "The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.\n",

      "I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but\n",

      "This dress does fit small.. i am generally a size 10-12 in maeve but purchased this in a 14. i have a large chest (34g) which contributed to my need to size up. the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on. i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress. my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and don't lie flat on my shoulders. other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it!\n",

      "I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!\n",
      "I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1\" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great. \r\n",

      "I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it's fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it's stretchy. i'm a 36d and it's hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!\n",

      "I purchased a medium. i am 5'6\" 140 lbs and it fit perfectly. the navy is pretty dark, almost black. the fabric is very soft. the cut is more form fitting in the top and then comes out to an a line. it is not as bulky as some swing dresses. in the photo it almost looks like a handkerchief hem, but in real life it is less pronounced. i have no negatives. i would consider getting a second pattern if it goes on sale.\n",
      "The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.\n",
      "I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe. i did purchase the petite since i'm 5'2\" and it worked out great. very nice style, comfy and flattering. looks great with a pair of boots. one of my go to dresses for sure.\n",
      "This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it's perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it's not too drastic. i'm 5'4\" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless, it's a great dress.\n",
      "I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9\", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.\n",
      "This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.\n",
      "I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4\" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.\n",
      "This dress was perfect for the fall/winter. i wish i would have bought more colors. the fabric is soft and clings just enough. i lived in it this winter.\n",
      "I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!\n",
      "This dress is very comfy and soft. i am returning because i didn't like it being a turtle neck, just a personal dislike.\n",
      "I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.\n",
      "Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it's not too clingy and it's flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass).\n",
      "I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print, but when i finally received, i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model, so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on\n",
      "Great dress! needs a tank top underneath, but has a great shop.\n",

      "I like the way the skirt of the dress swings when you move. in order to get the arm holes to not be too low, i ended up with the smaller of the two sizes i usually buy. i also appreciate the dress has pockets and the soft fabric. the tag says you can machine wash cold gentle which is also a plus!\n",

      "Cute, easy fitting dress. i got it in orange, which is a summery, pretty print. i ordered it in petite because i am 5'1\", but the dress is very short, so i'm exchanging it for a regular size. if you're average height, be aware that the dress will be well above the knee.\n",
      "They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.\n",
      "I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric is lovely, soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great, that is, until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine, i have a large bust, and the fabric stretched across the bust, causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.\n",
      "Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it, like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference, she's 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.\n",
      "I love this dress, it's flattering and a nice a line cut that is comfortable to wear, however there are 2 issues with this dress as mentioned by others. the dress is cut at least 1 size too small and the zipper is very difficult. typically i'm a 0 in mauve and i went up to a 2 as the 0 doesn't fit my (petite) rib cage. the zipper is annoying, but i can deal with it for the half off sale price i got with an additional 30% off.  i wouldn't have purchased this dress if it were full price, however.\n",

      "I don't usually pay full-price for retailer clothes, but i had a 20%-off coupon and i decided to give this dress a try, as it irradiated a happy vibe and reminded me of books and dress-up clothes from my childhood. i don't regret it one bit! the colors and the print are absolutely beautiful and i love how they mix up and contrast in a subtle way. i really like the long sleeves with the elastic at the wrist. the cord at the waist hangs with a fun mix of tiny beads, faux mini crab claws, and faux mi\n",
      "I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.\n",
      "This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!\n",
      "The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11\" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!\n",
      "This is such a fun dress to wear. i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes. im typically a small size 6 but went w x-small on this one to hug the shoulders more.\n",
      "The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult, but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.\n",
      "Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.\n",
      "I was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter, but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my 5'2\", 130 lb, 34d figure. the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper. i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller.\n",
      "I ordered a small and medium because i was worried about the chest being too tight (i am 5'6\", 140 lbs, 34d) but i was swimming in a size medium. it was huge. the small really fits me just fine. my only issue is that the very bottom of the sleeves is tight. i would like to push them up a little since they are 3/4 length, but they are tight. i am still keeping the small though....maybe i'll do surgery on the cuffs!\n",
      "I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.\n",
      "This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5\" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it.\n",
      "I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6\" self.\n",
      "This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1, athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room, so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.\n",
      "I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan, and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.\n",
      "The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)\n",
      "I purchased these jeans in my regular size.  they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels.. i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look. they are very stretchy and soft. have worn a few times and they retained thier shape...\n",
      "I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco\n",
      "Cloth and stone never lets me down! awesome quality, comfort, and versatility. i imagine myself living in this dress this summer! soft fabric, easy breezy fit, pockets, machine washable...what's not to love? go buy it!\n",
      "I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store, but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts), and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low\n",
      "\n",
      "Ref: 5'4\", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.\n",
      "Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.\n",
      "Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!\n",
      "I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.\n",
      "Usually a m, ordered a s and sp. the sp fit well. comfortable/flattering. fit note: picture makes it look like nude lining is a lot shorter, it is not - this was true in both sizes. great holiday/nye party dress. i disagree fabric feels cheap, but hem off pattern/not even. worth it on sale but not full price.\n",
      "This dress runs large!\r\n",
      "i tried on a large, then a medium and then a small! couldn't believe i fit a small! this is a cool, breezy summer ensemble that you can wear anywhere! dress it up or down, it's comfy and makes you feel like you can breathe under its baggy motif. love it!!\n",
      "The moment i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. the plaid is beautiful with tones of red, blue and periwinkle. the photos on the website are very true. the unexpected pockets make it even cuter. i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look. i an 5'5\" and usually wear a 4 or 6. i got the small and then wondered if it were too big. i ended up going back and trying on the extra small, but it turns out the small was correct. it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f\n",
      "I love this sweater. it's heavy, with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma. the cut is straight, and the collar feels natural. a small wraps closed across my chest (usually a s/4/6) without being baggy. falls to my mid-calf at 5'6\".\n",
      "This dress was exactly what i wanted. great material. cute pale blue slip lining the dress. i ordered a medium and it was perfect. i am about 5'6 and about 145. i received compliments all day on how cute it was\n",
      "There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.\n",
      "Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today, size down\n",
      "I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!\n",
      "This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!\n",
      "I really loved the fabric of this dress, however, it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.\n",
      "I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7\", 133, and a 36a. \r\n",
      "if you have been considering this dress, don't delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!\n",
      "This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.\n",
      "I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi\n",
      "Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11\" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.\n",
      "I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!\n",
      "These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes, even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!\n",
      "I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip, however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type, especially in a madras plaid.\n",
      "I'm 5'7 and 137 pounds and i tried on this dress in the store. i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove. this dress is great quality and feels good, looks good and can be dressed up or down. like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress. high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day. go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars. one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath\n",
      "I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod\n",
      "These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.\n",
      "I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9\" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it's a no-brainier purchase.\n",
      "If they still have your size, grab it. fits a bit snug in chest, but material is light and airy. got so many compliments on it. great style\n",
      "Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.\n",
      "I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders, armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh\n",
      "I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3\" 36dd 140#.\n",
      "This is my go to, cool, summer dress. it's very light and airy and extremely comfortable. great for 90 degree days!\r\n",
      "highly recommend!\n",
      "Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties\n",
      "I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "Love this dress so much. it's super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.\n",
      "I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy, but not too big.\n",
      "I love the length of this - no danger of explosing my muffin-top! the fabric is super cute - good weight, pretty color. i got a medium which is a bit blousy - i think i could have gone with a small.\n",
      "Gorgeous dress. it was designed to accentuate a woman's figure. lovely material, holds everything in place without being too revealing. the dress does not lose its shape. definitely a head turner\n",
      "I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.\n",
      "The waist is a little high and large, and this causes gapping in the small-of-the-back area. very cute dress, if it fit well. would probably work on someone less curvy. 00p, 5'4'',110lbs,32c for reference.\n",
      "This is one of the best purchases f\r\n",
      "i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.\n",
      "I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!\n",
      "This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.\n",
      "I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely top, very rich looking, i always get compliments. it's loose fitting but not baggy and the embroidery is well done.\n",
      "Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3\" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!\n",
      "I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.\n",
      "Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.\n",
      "Nice lines, just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.\n",
      "I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.\n",
      "I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5\"8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height,t eh other was so low, i could barely put my hand in it. however, the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice, but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs, but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size, so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for reference i am 115 lbs, 30 dd< 26.5 in waist.\n",
      "I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say, i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you, the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels, but i also like it with boots as\n",
      "There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.\n",
      "For once, the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "for me (5'3\", 32e, 125 lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8, but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).\n",
      "\n",
      "the dress is co\n",
      "I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.\n",
      "This top is really cute and can be worn off shoulder or not.  the embroidery is really pretty.  my only comment would be the top is shorter than i expected, if you wear it off shoulder its of course longer but still shorter than i would have preferred.  keeping it anyways as it will be a fun going out casual top.\n",
      "This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off, and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.\n",
      "Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.\n",
      "I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3\", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular\n",
      "I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!\r\n",
      "unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!\n",
      "I love good, flowy blouses and like the over sized look, but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it, but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on, because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.\n",
      "Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress\n",
      "This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too \"blousey\" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!\n",
      "I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.\n",
      "I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a \"flowy\" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.\n",
      "The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.\n",
      "My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!\n",
      "This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno\n",
      "Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.\n",
      "The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3\".  neckline is fem\n",
      "Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.\n",
      "I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6\" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me.\n",
      "This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely, i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!\n",
      "These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch, bind, or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!\n",
      "I got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern. the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving. i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines. it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some \"swing\" tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half. it's comfortable and flattering, could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi\n",

      "This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color, too, so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand, order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels \"slinky\" for lack of a better word. essentially, it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered, so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami, although in the lighter version i c\n",
      "I really wish i could keep this top. the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand, shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash. if you have the time to dry clean then i would 100% recommend this top. another tip if you buy this (since i didn't read the description) the top has buttons all down the front. i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldn't recommend this top to someone who is busty.\n",
      "A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure, this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.\r\n",
      "i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta, but definitely needed a large.\r\n",
      "i ordered the \"lavender\" color, which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead.\n",
      "I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.\n",
      "I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.\n",
      "I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!\n",
      "I got this shirt as a gift. it's cute and very comfortable. it is,however, a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath.\n",
      "This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..\n",
      "I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.\n",
      "Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.\n",
      "I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.\n",
      "I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.\n",
      "I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.\n",
      "I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect, but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.\n",
      "I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...\n",
      "I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom, the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!\n",
      "Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans\n",
      "Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.\n",
      "I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!\n",
      "Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try\n",
      "I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty, really perfect color for fall. i like that it's not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it's difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it's not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it's all polyester, which is just cheap fabric. if it wasn't for that, i'd give it 5 stars.\n",

      "I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4\"). i'm thinking about having it altered, not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out, it may be a better length for taller individuals.\n",
      "Cute shorts with great fabric (and lined so they lay smooth over your body). i really love that the material has a dressier feel, but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me (curvy body, 5'7'', 150). i'm returning them and trying a small. elastic waist is great for me after having a baby, but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt.\n",
      "The sales girl added this to my room, it's so darling and it came home with me.\n",

      "This dress has a beautiful pattern, and is perfect for work. i wore it with tights recently, but could see wearing it in the summer too- the print is versatile enough that it translates. the top layer is sort of a crepe like fabric and there were a lot of strings that needed to be cut that were hanging off. i got many compliments the first time i wore this! i'm very curvy and i got the medium and it fits great and is very flattering.\n",
      "I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.\n",
      "The fit, once you get it on is as flattering as can be. its beautiful quality is undeniable. the problem and it's a big one...you can't get it on without destroying your nails. the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone. 'dear designer, you forgot the zipper. sincerely, women everywhere'. i loved it so much but just couldn't buy an outfit that was going to take me 20 minutes to put on and since it is a jumper it would be a process throughout wearing\n",

      "This is a swingy shape which means a lot of fabric on the bottom half. so many retailer tops could be maternity wear for this reason, i'm ready for the trend to die out! that said, this print is very pretty and the fabric is great - not sheer for a nice change. i'm returning it because the arm holes are large and my bra shows at the sides. this is a pet peeve of mine. i don't want to wear a cami under a tank. almost a home run, i'm tempted to try one size down but i wouldn't like it shorter so i p\n",
      "This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not \"pull on styling\". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!\n",
      "This jumpsuit is a classic!!!!! i read the reviews where some were complaining about the buttons i did not have these issues (maybe because i have short fingernails). i like this jumpsuit because the style of it will be around for a long time. you can dress the jumpsuit up or down. i rarely pay full price but this jumpsuit is so great/fantastic, that i did not mind doing so. i strongly recommend this jumpsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dress is very cute on the model online, but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.\n",
      "The print is unique and fun. however, the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.\n",
      "Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "These pants have great style and movement.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in, but decided in the end to return because i just didn't love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice,  though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.\n",
      "As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)\n",
      "This top is cute, my kind of style, but it is really sheer. i would need to wear a white tank top underneath.\n",
      "This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4\", 123 lbs\n",
      "I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!\n",
      "This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp\n",

      "Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5\" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer, but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color, being nude as indicated, is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and\n",
      "Love the idea of this top, but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.\n",
      "This top can be dressed up or down. i got it in the blue motif. it is so cute and that wearable, washable fabric. i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too low-cut (i.e. professionalism). this top fits the bill while still being fabulous. of course it is loose-fitting on the bottom, as the image indicates. it is a swing top. i recommend with skinny pants.\n",
      "I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.\n",
      "I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit, i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didn't design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept\n",
      "I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8\" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.\n",
      "Although this is an online only, i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store. this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo. it doesn't show as much in the model photos, but this top has a subtle high-low effect, which adds a bit of elegance to the top.\r\n",

      "Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top\n",
      "I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!\n",
      "I ordered this and didn't even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just wasn't what i was looking for as far as color. also, the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well, thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a\n",

      "I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.\n",

      "These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9\" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.\n",

      "I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.\n",
      "This is a soft, comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular t-shirt - not dressy, but a little more put together looking. it also doesn't wrinkle, so it's my go-to travel shirt for warmer months.\n",
      "I love this top! i've already worn it 3 times since getting it about 2 weeks ago. it is beautiful and has a lovely, subtle pattern to the fabric that i didn't initially see in the photo, but then did and still wanted it. it has a nice drape and is comfortable and flattering. my only critique is that it comes up a little shorter on my torso than i expected. i am a medium/size 8 with 34d bust and the top comes to maybe 2 inches below my belly button. i think it's still flattering and comfortable,\n",
      "I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great, so soft & comfy, but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me, it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top, but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model, this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.\n",
      "I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing\n",
      "I was expecting a lot more, but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose, just too loose, as it runs very very large i returned it\n",
      "I bought this to wear in the warm climates, when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car, it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much, going to by another one similar and have on again!\n",
      "I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer, so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top, especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4'', 120 pounds, and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.\n",
      "Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.\n",
      "Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!\n",
      "Love this dress! the embroidery is stunning and adds to each detail of the dress. i love the pink undertone. it is subtle. it makes it more unique. this is why i love online exclusives. they have that \"one of a kind\" look to them. the quality is great and the style is that there really is no shape to it. it has a nice everyday feel, but along with its elegance, can easily be dressed up as well. priced a little high is my only complaint.\n",
      "All the reviews have said the truth. this shirt is absolutely adorable in terms of the top. but you will definitely need this tailored at the waist. give it a little more taper at the seams to suit a woman's curves. it seems almost funny they didn't do it to start with given the really feminine details on this shirt with the lace and the sleeves...\n",
      "Absolutely adorable!!! i must object to previous reviewers who have stated that the top \"fits nothing like that of the model in the photo\". i have found that it fits exactly like that \"look\". i usually wear xl but bought this one in large as the price was too good to pass up! this top affords the slightly slouchy look on top (thanks to the dolman sleeves) but with a bit more fit or i should say....with a bit better fit through the midriff than that of the model. one reviewer stated this top make\n",
      "The shirt is beautiful but slightly long. it is see thru and you do need to wear a cami underneath.\n",
      "The colors on this top are very bright & cheery. i love wearing this top. i get a lot of complements on the combination of the pastel colors. it reminds me of a warm summer day. i wear a pink tank under neath and it really brings out the pink colors of the top.\n",
      "I love this tank top - it is perfect for work and dressing up a more casual outfit. the fact that it has small cutouts is cute and doesn't make it so you absolutely have to wear a tank under it in more casual situations. i love the colors and the boxy fit. great purchase!\n",
      "The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting.\n",
      "I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small, however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of \"i need to borrow that from you\"! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4\" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!\n",
      "I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.\n",
      "I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal, but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything, looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice, but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly, unfortunately. had to return it.\n",

      "This jumpsuit looked so great on the model, and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4\" and in great shape, and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!\n",

      "First of all, this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online, i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans, i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist, big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also, there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck\n",
      "This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person, but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today, i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.\n",

      "I ordered bought a medium for a comfortable fit. the material is stretchy, so size down for a body - hugging fit.\n",
      "I've been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons. the elastic waist \"holds\" the romper in place when you take the top off, the top comes off easily bc it's a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated. the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back. it's better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture. it is a bit long (comes down to my ankles) but looks good with heels.\n",
      "Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos, there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that, it's a beautiful, unique summer top.\n",
      "I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it's easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i didn't want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it doesn't stretch out much.\n",
      "Great quality and beautiful color! i wear size 6 and ordered s. got lots of compliments :)\n",
      "Fyi-the model is wearing the top with a cami tank under. on it's own, it's lace and has holes throughout. i prefer it that way, so you can layer to make it more conservative, but also wear with a nude bra for an edgier look. material washed well and has a pretty raw lace edge seam on the bottom!\n",
      "This top is so beautiful! whenever i wear it i get lots of compliments. i have washed it a few times on delicate and it still looks great. i do have to wear a cami under it, but the way the straps of the top are made, you cannot see see my bra or cami strap.\n",
      "Nice quality, definitely need to wear a tank top or camisole cause this doesn't come with it. color is great not too bright. true to size. if you want short length zed a petite size.\n",
      "I couldn't decide whether to get it in the black and white stripe or the blue, so i bought both. these t-shirts are incredible--soft, comfortable, fit well (i'm 5'2 usually a size 2 in retailer clothing, xs fit true to size for this shirt). the blue is vibrant and, as another reviewer noted, there's a tiny black stripe in between the blue and white. the black and white is actually more of a cream/offwhite but still pleasing and versatile. sleeves roll up easily, which is a preference of mine. they\n",
      "The colors of this top are my favorite part, i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!\n",
      "Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.\n",
      "I'm another borderline petite at 5'4\", and i loved this. the pants are like palazzos on me, and i think with a heel it will look great. i plan on wearing my hair up and tying the tie in the back in a big bow. in fact, i don't see the button back spoken of in the description, so i think one would have to do so!\n",
      "This was a perfectly nice dress, but embroidery was less elegant than i had expected. be sure to look closely at the neckline, where the material is thick and somewhat informal. it's pretty, but doesn't work for me. otherwise, it is a well made, comfortable, easy-to-wear summer dress. (i sent it back, but thought about it for a while first.)\n",
      "This top is really pretty. it's a very strong embroidered lace all over (front and back) with small holes. but, the description states there is a polyester lining, and this is unlined! so,there are holes. but, i do not think this is immodest and needs a cami. just wear a nude bra under it. the holes are not revealing at all.\r\n",

      "I am on the fence on this one........it's quite beautiful as color goes, the pic online seems rather faded. i just felt it was a bit wider on the bottom than might be flattering otherwise. beautifully made and the fabric is of great quality. \r\n",

      "This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.\n",
      "The quality of the fabric these are made from is wonderful- they are soft yet structured and i was so bummed they didn't fit me. i usually wear a size 28 in premium denim so i ordered a 28 and i could barely pull these up over my hips. once i pulled them on i was about 1-2 inches from being able to zip them closed. the pants fit in the legs but they were very close-fitting, which is not the look i'm going for. i am 5'5\" and was worried they would look too long since usually pants are for me, but\n",
      "First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret\n",
      "This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also, the colors in t\n",
      "This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said \"wow that's very elegant\". it is very soft. thin but warm. however, it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality\n",
      "As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist, i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short, too wide in the hips, and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.\n",
      "I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)\n",
      "This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a 2 or 4 in retailer, and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.\n",
      "I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31\" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro\n",
      "This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5\" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show\n",
      "I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type, i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size, i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa, 26\",\n",
      "Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful, ordered it, shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!\r\n",

      "This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this top, but the fit was just off on me. the design and material is so pretty. however, i expected the fit to be more \"peplum\", but there was not any structure. i think this would be better on more slender women.\n",
      "Love the way this top fits. got many compliments on it! wish the arm holes were a little closer fit - can see the bra peeking out a teensy bit.\n",
      "I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!\n",
      "I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.\n",
      "This is a wonderfully-made top. i love the colors! if you are busty you must size up! this fabric doesn't give (stretch) at all.\n",
      "Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price, but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!\n",
      "I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10, even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa\n",
      "Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.\n",

      "pros:\n",
      "- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.\n",
      "- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.\n",
      "- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.\n",

      "The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes! hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brand...stunning\n",
      "Sadly, this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11\" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.\n",
      "It is a pretty tank, the fabric feels nice and substantial.\n",
      "Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans, sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over, and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3\" 115# for reference.\n",
      "So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have\n",
      "Bought this on sale in my reg size- 10. im 5'9\" and about 36c. the fabric is heavy and pretty. this is a more formal top in my opinion. it is lined. it is much wider around the waist than appears on model. zips up the back, but i can pull on and off without unzipping.\n",
      "I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful, however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long, so additional hemming required, otherwise fit was true to size (5'3, 130 lbs, size 6p)\n",
      "I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short, biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but, this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short, nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip, for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large, i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re\n",
      "I bought this dress in a medium petite. i'm 5'2 and 140#. it fit great and made my waist look really tiny. i cannot wait the dress with heels or else you would see the entire shoe. it works perfect with flat sandals. i've received tons of compliments! you can also wear a normal bra with the dress. love it!\n",
      "This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10\" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!\n",
      "A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering, amazing quality, soft material, good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!\n",
      "I like this dress. very nice easy to wear everyday dress. the top is lined but the bottom is a bit thin and unlined. i don't think it was too sheer though. it seems much of the quality of retailer is going down a bit. disappointed overall in the quality of their dresses this year.\n",
      "I ordered this in the china pattern color, and the colors are vibrant and beautiful! the suit is well made and slimming. there are no bra cups; just a shelf bra, but the tie halter adds some extra support. i have trouble buying bathing suits, but i am very happy with this one.\n",
      "When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7\" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going\n",
      "I adore this maxi! the fit, style, pattern (black motif), machine washability, everything! fits tts (got my usual size s for 5'7\", 125lbs). i would say that the length is appropriate - some are super long on me, and i'm not one to wear heels. i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug - my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest - no problem with this dress! i think it's perfect piece for spring/summer/fall and dressing up or down. my one slight\n",
      "I agree with another reviewer. the neckline is just right, not too low cut and a normal bra should work fine. also it would be nice if this dress were lined. the top part has more than one layer so that's not an issue, but the skirt doesn't so i'll likely wear spanks. other than that, it's a great maxi and perfect for spring or summer (light weight)..\n",
      "I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed! i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent. i have a rather big chest (36dd) and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me. look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!\n",
      "This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t\n",

      "Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however, the proportions are off. based on other reviews, i ordered a petite (i am 5'4\" and don't normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck won't be almost to my belly button.\n",
      "Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!\n",

      "I was on the fence about getting this maxi because it's a tad pricey but ended up scoring an retailer coupon that took a bit of the sting out of the price. i'm so glad i went ahead and ordered it! it's absolutely lovely! i'm 5'3\", 117# and got an xs petite; it fits like a glove and is the perfect length to wear with either flats or a higher heel. love, love, love!\n",
      "I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.\n",
      "Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down. i get tons of complaints on this dress- it's a definite win!\n",
      "I ordered this dress online and i love it! i'm only 5'2\" so it's always a challenge for me with maxis but this one fit the bill. not too much fabric to be overwhelming on a shorter frame and the length was perfect. the fabric is very comfortable and moves with you. also the quality is great! i ordered a small petite but i probably could have gone xs petite. this would dress would be flattering on most people. need same dress, more colors!\n",
      "The material is nice and has a lot of stretch. i ordered the small as i'm a 6 in most dresses. it fits comfortably  i could probably get away with xs but have a large chest so was afraid it wouldn't cover me. i'm 5'2\" so a petite might be a bit better but it was sold out. i'll have to wear tall wedges with this one.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9\", 140 lbs and a size 4 fit perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person, and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.\n",
      "This dress is very forgiving on my post baby body. i'm glad i purchased the petite, it hits my ankle perfectly (i'm 5'5\"). very versatile, i can see wearing this at work (with a blazer) or on a weekend.\n",
      "This is my new favorite dress! i can't tell you how flattering it is. i just had a baby a few months ago, and it's the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old, pre-baby self in! i'm on the shorter side (5'3\"#, very busty #because i'm nursing# and about 118 lbs. i got a mp and it fits great. i could have gotten the small, but i feel that would have been too low cut. honestly, love the cut, the pattern, everything about it. would buy again!\n",
      "I was disappointed in this bordeaux top, a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium, my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also, the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra, the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.\n",
      "I love my new maxi dress! as soon as i put it on, i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer. i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage. you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress. the material is soft, light, and flows well. i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress - it adds that extra little feminine touch. i can't wait to wear it.\n",
      "I think it's a cute dress, but nothing spectacular. that being said, i get a lot of compliments. it's a very flattering cut, but i wish it was more colorful, not just black and white. i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and got the s, i could have probably gotten the xs too, but i'm happy with how the s fits. great length too, since i often have a hard time finding dresses that are long enough for me.\n",
      "I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish, but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online, and the fabric is so soft, it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely, and so it's flattering. overall, a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.\n",
      "This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'4 and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!!\n",
      "One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said, best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high, but it was worth it!\n",
      "I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5\", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!\n",
      "This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3\" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!\n",
      "I'm 5'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress, but didn't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely. \r\n",

      "i ordered a size 2\n",
      "Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6\" and got a large. with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls. \r\n",
      "ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess\n",
      "I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge. glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable. i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length. originally, i had also considered xxsp. while it fit well above the waist, it was slightly too short. for reference, i'm 5 ft 3.5 inches, 105 pounds.\n",
      "This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7\" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend.\n",
      "These are so comfy! mom of two boys on the go! great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town! not mom jeans!\n",
      "Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi\n",
      "Another perfect maxi from retailer! the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my normal size in maxis (medium) and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight. i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i don't feel like i am showing too much cleavage. it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect.\n",
      "Love this skirt. i love that it is pleated and sheer on the bottom. i'm so happy i found it online! love anything maeve, you can count on the quality and simple elegance.\n",
      "I'm 5'4\", 32c and 125 lbs. i ordered the size 4p and while the color and fabric is pretty, the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps. it was also very tight across my ribs. despite ordering a petite, the hem was much too long. i ended up returning it.\n",
      "Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others, i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.\n",
      "The cut is wonderful and the fabric is soft and flowy. it is pretty sheer so a slip is recommended. i wish this dress had a lining like some other dresses i've gotten at retailer.\n",
      "Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.\n",
      "I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.\n",
      "As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!\n",
      "I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. also, the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing \"anything\"! definitely can wear a normal bra\n",
      "This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!\n",
      "This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique, adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work, party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.\n",
      "I'm on the smaller end of the bust spectrum even nursing i'm a 32c/d at my fullest. i adore this suit. there is zero support so if you need that move on don't buy this. i love it -hides the post partum baby puff, pattern detracts from flaws, deep plunge is modest yet still sexy and it's super stretchy and easily be pulled aside to feed a baby. underneath there's a fabric bra insert so if you bend over nothing can be seen which i like. haven't worn in water or waves yet but fabric feels awesome.\n",
      "This is the perfect dress to take traveling. dress it up with heels or down with sandals. warm up and wear it with a short black sweater. a nice easy elegant dress. size small fit nicely, medium probably would have been fine too.\n",
      "This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even, and maybe especially, because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire, which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size, but might run a tad lar\n",
      "Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.\n",
      "The \"movement\" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, \"yeah, i can wear these attitude!\" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is \"thick\" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh\n",
      "This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!), and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full, but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.\n",
      "This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering, you can wear a normal bra with it (for me, very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily. \r\n",

      "I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot, the color is highly versatile, it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm, and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan, likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to\n",
      "These are just as cute as pictured. they are generously sized made from soft denim. the denim has quite a bit of stretch. i ordered a size down from my normal size. i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets. they were still attached to the inside of the pockets. it just made them feel a little unfinished. these didn't impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment. the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three strap-length adjustments on the straps. the\n",
      "Love this shirt...got it in the \"blue\" but i will say the print is a very dark navy, almost black. i'm 130 lbs, 34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!\n",
      "As other reviewers have said, this shirt runs a little short and wide. i usually wear petite, so the length didn't bother me. the sleeves fit me perfectly (which is rare in regular sizing), so others may find that they are too short and tight. to fix the boxiness issue, i just stitched 2 of the seams in the back together to give it more shape. since i bought the black pattern, my diy fix isn't too obvious but this may not work for the other colors. it needed a little work, but it was worth it fo\n",
      "Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing i've ever seen!! i literally bought it as soon as a saw it. i got a size 2. i'm usually a 0 or 00 in most blouses and shirts, but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up. it's definitely not oversized even though i sized up. the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front - really flattering in my opinion. the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf!\n",
      "First off the prints are gorgeous - i ordered three. i wanted to love them but unfortunately i found them short and wide. so back they go..\n",
      "I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful!! quality is worth it...i agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look ....the color is gorgeous..lighter shade of brown...so thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol!\n",

      "Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.\n",
      "This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4\", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online.\n",
      "I am partial to maeve tops, i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering, i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a 4 (i go between 2 and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f\n",
      "As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don\n",
      "What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there wasn't much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however, the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out\n",
      "Bought with the 25% off retailer was running -- usually a little skeptical of maeve regarding size but the material of these shirts is excellent. bought the ski print and the red penguin print. perfect for low-key and where i work!\n",
      "I am submitting this review because there were size issues mentioned in some reviews. i generally wear a size 4 but often size up to a 6 because i'm a d cup. i purchased an 8 in this because of reviews saying it was small. trying it on , the 8 is fine but it does tent out a lot at the bottom. i think i may have been fine with the 6 because of that; it seems a little big from the back view.\n",
      "I usually wear a 4 in maeve, and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7\", 34c, size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well, though, if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist, the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue, but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo\n",
      "High quality, soft, thick fabric that drapes well, keeps you warm, and figure flattering. i'm 5'4 and the length is perfect. the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything. love the design detail throughout. this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes, go with the smaller size for a tailored fit.\n",

      "So, i'm really surprised that reviewers said the fit was too small and too tight in the arms. i'm 5'7\" and 183lbs and my husband (god bless his soul) bought me an 8 for my birthday. i tried it on just to see and was pretty impressed i could button it across my chest and get it over my arms as those are common problem areas for me. regardless i need to exchange the shirt for a larger size because even though i got it on its not how is supposed to look. the shirt is loose around the midsection whi\n",
      "I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side\n",
      "It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.\n",
      "Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts, lovely color and a staple classic.\n",
      "When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch\n",
      "This blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back. it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in. it's unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey.\n",
      "I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.\n",
      "I read the other reviews that said the shirt ran small but i found that it fit fine and i chose my regular size in maeve. the only issue is that it's baggy around the middle which is a little off and i found that it was a little too short. i gave it four stars because of the print. i chose the cat print and it's just so adorable. i might try to have the shirt taken in at the waist and then it would be perfect.\n",
      "Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops, and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however, i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me, but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't\n",
      "Soft  stretch denim, 70's fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this , but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27, my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn't zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won't have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area\r\n",

      "The straps are long but work ok for me. the material is very soft and the color (pink) is very nice. this is a tank you can wear under almost anything as the soft silky fabric will allow whatever you wear to glide right over it....no sticking!\n",
      "This top is too short, so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely, but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.\n",
      "Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.\n",
      "I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok, maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight, but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!\n",
      "I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to\n",
      "I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers, i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though, so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart\n",

      "The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.\n",
      "Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5\"10\" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i'm all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'\n",

      "I love the design on this top- so playful! i was super confused on what size to buy since all the reviews said different things, so i bought a size 0 and size 2. i'm usually a size 0 or xs is most clothes, and after trying both on, i kept the size 0. it's ever so slightly snug in the chest area, but the sleeves and shoulder areas fit perfectly. the size 2 was a little too wide and drapey and the sleeves were a little long.\n",

      "I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak\n",

      "What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!\n",
      "I wasn't able to purchase this item because i just couldn't get the size right in the bust. the small puckered at the bust and i swam in the medium. bummed because the colors are so vibrant and pretty and the length and flow were great!\n",

      "I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first, i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on, it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch, but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors, i'd buy them all lol.\n",
      "Pretty design, but when i tried it on, the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier, it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.\n",

      "This shirt looked plain online, but when i see it in store, i thought it's so pretty! it is the over-sized style, when i tried it on, it's so flattering, even though it is over-sized but it doesn't make you look chunky at all! i got it while it was on sale with extra 25% off! i range from 2 to 6, xs, s for retailer sizes. i got a xs for this top.\n",

      "This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it's really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!\n",

      "I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat, the fabric is light and breathes. however, pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.\n",
      "This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.\n",
      "I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.\n",
      "I love the pattern and flowy design.  i also like the peach liner but i will use that on other outfits i own and replace it with a slip that has a designed hem.  this top is too long for me to wear as a top. so i will wear as a dress with the a longer slip.  i'm hoping that the sequins will remain intact for the most part as the construction of everything is too delicate.  bought the size s and i am 6'3\" 140# 39-28-35.\n",
      "Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on! the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable. the dress is oversized but a little too much so. i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape, otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric.\n",
      "This is my third pair of ag primas - i love them! the higher rise is nice to keep smooth lines, they're made of such soft material that moves with you rather than restricts you, and the cut of the legs is skinny without being skin tight. absolutely my favorites jeans - retailer, sell more washes and i'll buy 'em!! :)\n",

      "While there is nothing wrong with this top, it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store, maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much, especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.\n",
      "I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)\n",
      "I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.\n",
      "When i saw this online, i knew i'd have to order it fast--it's just gorgeous. i got it in the mail today and couldn't be happier! i'm usually xs in angel of the north sweaters and this was no exception- it fit great. colors are as pictured.\n",
      "This top is so darling, the different textures are so elegant that you really don't even need to accessorize. it has a very flattering cut and a must for any figure.\n",
      "A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.\n",
      "Amazingly soft, thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!\n",
      "I'm heavier than i'd like to be and this fits. the rear emphasizes mine. my only compliant is that the faux fir collar is buttoned on in six places, leaving gaps that my fingers catch in, that can hook on things, and that require me to adjust it to be sure i've got it lying flat when i put it on. the faux fir is so realistic a veterinarian asked me what animal it was from! lovely color, not starkly black but dark. it's not at all a winter coat weight, but rather a moderately warm non-bulky sweat\n",
      "Beautiful dress, can be dressed up or down. runs just a bit large, but if i had sized down it would have been too tight in the bust (38d). i normally wear a medium and the medium was perfect in the chest. the color is absolutely gorgeous and i love the length - i don't like dresses that show my knees. my only complaint is that a dress that is this expensive even on sale should have better quality control. mine made it to me without a button at the the back. not a huge deal, but it won't be easy\n",
      "There's no doubt that this tee is sheer. i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue. the fit is true to size, with just enough room for drape without being too oversized. the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather!\n",
      "I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color, which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.\n",
      "Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7\" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.\n",
      "I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7\" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there, but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath.\n",
      "Wonderful fabric, drapes nicely from waist= flattering, use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight, patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual\n",
      "This will be a 3 season dress for me.. its well made, comfy and flattering . the suede skirt is risky i know .. but i'll be sure to put the napkin in my lap!\n",
      "I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9\" and i'm under 5' 6\" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it\n",
      "I so wanted to love this dress! the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer! i was so disappointed by the fit through. the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasn't executed that well. one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to \"constrict\", the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average. on the bottom where it's flowy it doesn't make that much of a difference, but on top and in the middle it gives this weird \"i\n",
      "I get a lot of compliments on this dress, it's bright and cheerful for sure! it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress!\n",
      "I ordered the petite in my size, since i'm well petite, but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately, for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits, but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.\n",
      "This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu\n",
      "Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate, but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.\n",
      "This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow, but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine, especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric, but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally, the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!\n",
      "I love this sweater coat;! it's so nice and fits well. would look great with jeans or a skirt. the collar is adorable! have already worn it and received compliments! i love retailer :)!!\n",
      "I drooled over this dress online, so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person, & the drape of the skirt (good quality, fully lines), i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight, ill-fitting, & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone, regardless of chest size. it's a shame, because otherwise, the dress is adorable!\n",
      "I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.\n",
      "This sweater is much more beautiful in person. the quality is very good and the fur is nice too!! i am 5'8 inches and 155 lbs and the medium fit me perfect.\n",
      "This dress is cuter is person than online, but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or, maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.\n",
      "This sweater is very nicely made...i got a lot of compliments the first time i wore it. it's a light sweater and looks great with jeans! love it\n",
      "This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter, who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear, said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!\n",
      "I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5\" tall, 135 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves didn't sl\n",
      "Comfortable but if you put in the dryer, even on low it will shrink a little so beware\n",
      "I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves, however, ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts, no fitted places, nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned, it sprea\n",
      "This is a unique color, and a lovely dress. i have the yellow, and i didn't find that it ran large. it definitely has a loose, flowing fit, and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks. the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics, but i don't think it looks odd. you have several pictures of people wearing them, and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone!\n",
      "I just received this in the mail today and haven't taken it off since! i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it. can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it. can not wait to wear it for the holidays!\n",
      "Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend day.\r\n",
      "i have it in black but thinking of buying in the yellow/orange color too.\n",
      "I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering, even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering, it's just odd. and the fit is super huge, you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute, but was executed so poorly.\n",
      "I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however, the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it, kind of chartreuse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i returned the item because it didn't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me.\n",
      "Beautiful and classy- i love this! i'm 5'8\"/125lbs/34b and my usual xs works great (could probably also have worn a s). i was a little worried it'd be scratchy and/or too structured, but it's soft and flattering. photos are accurate. would definitely recommend!\n",
      "This dress is really beautiful, cheerful, the color lovely, the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style, fabric, and color. i am 5' 5\" with long legs and a shorter upper body, so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size, but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely\n",
      "I'll admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer, but not necessarily the quality. however, this dress happily has both! the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits. i do think the sizing is off; i'm 5'5\", 137, 34b and the medium (my usual size) was huge, small was still gaping under the arms, and xs fit perfectly. i haven't worn an xs in anything since middle school, ha! the banding at the bust does make it tight, so i can we\n",
      "I recently purchased this dress in the yellow, which is not advertised online, but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also, you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9\" and the length was perfect for me, will be able to wear with heels or flats.\n",
      "Like another reviewer, i was in the store looking for the vest with the faux fur collar and tie-waist. it turned out to be too long/bulky for my small frame, or there wasn't an xs (can't recall), but i saw this and it's just the thing i didn't even know i needed. i'm fairly thin and petite at 5'4 and drown in most cardigans. this is just long enough. it was a subtle a-line shape. fabric is not thick but is substantial enough that it's still warm. i also like that it's hand washable, nice to have\n",
      "This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on. the fit is true to size for a swing coat. being a heather black helps with the no show of lint. i will wear this no doubt for years to come. thanks retailer.!!!\n",
      "This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li\n",
      "I wanted this dress in yellow from the moment i first saw it on instagram. i waited for it to be available online and once it was i ordered it. i am usually a size medium but sized down to a small petitie (5'5\") -- and the fit is off. i am a 34b so its too roomy in the chest. because i love everything else about this dress i am going to re-order in an xs petite but that will be two sizes down for me. not sure if it will fit. length was good. looks great with a dark denim jacket . the dress is li\n",
      "This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy, and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner, and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.\n",
      "This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'2 about 105 pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you won't\n",
      "I'm 5'4 with an hourglass shape. i love this dress. it drapes nicely, the material won't be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion.\n",
      "This is so soft and has wonderful drape. i want to love it. it is not gold. not in my opinion anyway. the \"gold\" parts look like muted lime green to me. it's true to size and looks similar to the picture otherwise. i just don't know about that color- especially on me.\n",
      "I love this shirt. the quality is great, and very soft. the length seems a bit short, i will only wear it tucked in to a higher waisted skirt. the arm holes are tight.\n",
      "Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish, flattering, soft, versatile, etc, etc...\n",
      "I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.\n",
      "Love the dress, a little cheaply made but overall, it fits nice and will be great next fall. it will show tummy shape so if you do not have a flat tummy, this may not be the dress for you.\n",
      "I have a gala to go to wear i am a board member. i had been eyeing this dress online and tried it in store! lurve! i got the black one which is a black lace over a sheer cotton nude, i also got the regular when i am petite as it hit longer for a black tie event. i have a large bust at 5'2\" size d, but small and short torso and the large just hugged the girls just right. i love the it can be worn fancy with block heels to a gala or wit ha jean jacket or espradilles for a casual summer night. this\n",
      "This sweater coat is so cute!! i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big. i always wear s tops from retailer....was a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over things....so glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large. i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at 20% off and it was a treat for myself!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous on the hanger and even more gorgeous on. definitely runs big though, so sizing down is probably best.\n",
      "This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.\n",
      "As stated in my review title, they're amazing! they're incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 5'3 isn't surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldn't recommend these enough\n",
      "I don't understand the negative review\r\n",
      "on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s\n",
      "Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent, with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long. \r\n",
      "so comfy you can wear it as a robe!\r\n",
      "looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large, which i like in a bulky cardi.\r\n",
      "super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price.\n",
      "Retailer has great designs but sometimes they use cheap fabrics and are not quality made. this top is quality made and super soft. its a little thicker than a normal cotton t-shirt but thinner than a sweatshirt. i normally wear medium (34dd, 135-140 lbs, 5'4\") and this was tts. i got the blue and its a little bit darker in person. one big plus imo is that you can put it in washer and dryer, no need to line dry! i am going to buy the natural colored stripes one too. also, i bought the normal size.\n",
      "This skirt is very stretchy and a nice soft thickish fabric. the pattern is also very cute. i ordered the xs p and it fit just right, length was pretty much as pictured, just at or slightly below the knee. the opening in front was also as shown, a bit wide, not a slit but shaped like a thin arc. overall, i still recommended it, it rusn pretty true to size (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist)\n",
      "I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers - you will also!\n",
      "Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium, but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.\n",
      "I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly, these pants are going back.\n",
      "Love these pants, i am 5'2 and these fit in length nicely!\n",
      "The shirt was cute. i'm very petite and it ran very wide so didn't fit me well.\n",
      "I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8\" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch.\n",
      "I would have liked it but it was too small for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the store to buy the transcend verdugo ankle in blue. however,i left with it in blue and black. the black is perfect. absolutely amazing fabric that shapes your behind, and no ones is more imperfect than mine. i cant say enough about these except paige rocks! i'm a fan!!\n",
      "What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.\n",
      "This is a simplistic beauty. the colors are lovely and as pictured. i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size. i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it. the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall, winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate.\n",
      "This blouse is basically a rectangular piece of fabric that is folded over and sewn up the sides. the side seams are about 2-3 inches in from the edge of the fabric. the neck opening is finished nicely. the fabric has a nice drape to it, but the design on the front isn't as crisp and clear as i thought it would be; the design is a bit fuzzy. so i wish the picture on the front were clearer. i always wear an xl in retailer tops, but the size l in this fit nicely in the bust except is too snug at the\n",
      "This is a top-flight notch: an attractive design, nicely made. for me, the fabric is rather heavy for summer wear, but that won't prevent me from keeping it for cooler days. my one complaint is the sizing. i weigh a bottom-heavy 146 lbs. and hoped i'd get away with a medium. but it swims on me...not \"a bit too large,\" but \"way too large.\" i'm returning it and hoping that a small will be small enough.\n",
      "This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look, or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed, but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy, i highly recommend!\n",
      "I was not going to purchase this jacket thinking it was too pricely but i am glad that i did. true to size and made with great craftsmanship. it looks very delicate but made strong. very pretty .... true too picture. it works out perfect for after yoga!\n",
      "Love these pants, they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware, if you are curvy, you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.\n",
      "I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.\n",
      "This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i usually wear a size 4 in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a 2 in this skirt. the size 2 fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the 4 looked bulkier on me,\n",
      "I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.\n",
      "Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.\n",
      "Beautiful dress! it looks fresh, feminine and the quality of the fabric is very nice.\n",
      "I bought this in my usual size small (i'm a 4-6, 27\" waist, 32b), and it fits perfectly. it's a little loose and boxy but still structured and cute (it fits me like the model). i don't find it itchy at all, and the embroidery is just gorgeous. this is perfect for transitioning from summer to fall!\n",
      "Picked this up end of season sale, but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto\n",
      "I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says \"cold water wash\". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!\n",
      "Wanted to buy this dress, but the bust area was way too small. as i went up sizes, the torso began to be too long, and i would have to have it altered, i guess. what a shame.\r\n",
      "but, if you are small chested, then this is your dress.\n",
      "I love the color and design of this suit, however, the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself! i am 5'7\" 110 lbs., with a very small bust and a short waist. i think the suit runs very small, as i am a size xs/s in most of retailers clothing. i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite!\n",
      "This cropped trouser is very high quality and perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size petite 4 (i am 5'2\" 115 lb) and i felt a little tight but since other previous reviews said they do stretch after wearing it, i decided to keep it. i hope they stretch out a little bit more. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.\n",
      "If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.\n",

      "This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.\n",

      "This top is cute, but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs, but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2\", 110 lbs, 34a). even worse, though, was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined, so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy, and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt, but not worth actually wearing.\n",
      "The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de\n",

      "This shirt totally exceeded my expectations -- the detail and colors are wonderful, and the shirt itself is quite comfortable. the shirt is a bit boxy, but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on. plus, it looks great with jeans or with a skirt -- it is very easy to style!\n",

      "I really love this shirt for its versatility. it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt, or even jeans and heels. the shirt itself is super soft. it's boxier than it looks in the picture, but not to the point of crop-top. the shirt still hits at my hips.\n",
      "I love the idea of this shirt-- the embroidered pattern is fun and summery! the fit of the shirt is a little strange. i saw that in other reviews, but i had to see for myself. it is rather boxy. i think i may keep it, though. i will look cute with super fitted skinny jeans to balance out the boxiness of the top.\n",
      "I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3\", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money\n",

      "I love this top because it is light weight (a must in southern heat). i have a shorter torso so the length didn't bother me but someone with a longer torso may find this top too short.\n",
      "Just too much cuteness! the print is amazing, the bow is darling, and the crisp structure keeps it from being too precious. looks amazing on my hourglass shape! runs a bit small--had to size up a bit and felt more comfortable once i put a piece of fashion tape in a spot that gapped a little. definitely worth the splurge!\n",

      "I loved this dress so much, but it just didn't work. i'm not particularly busty (36b) but it just did not work for me. i sized up several sizes from what i usually wear and it still was tight on the bust and then just looser around the arms as i went up. such a beautiful dress though - great quality and really adorable fit for someone who is built for it!\n",

( i am a 38b, 5'9\", and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium, it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1\" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok.\n",

      "I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.\n",
      "I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd. it looked okay on the hanger, but when i tried it on...wow! so pretty and chic. it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono. (my husband's words) i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments. i did not have any issues with fit. i am a size 6 and purchased a size 6. it fit\n",
      "It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.\n",

      "I bought this dress as a back-up for my bridal shower and loved it when it arrived. it does run large, so definitely size down. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress, but the quality is high, the color is really vibrant and it's a comfortable fit. i'm 5'5 and it fell to my knees. i paired it with black tights and booties and plan on wearing it the spring with wedges.\n",

      "First of all, this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly, it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless, it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however, i was able to go down a siz\n",
      "This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.\n",
      "This shirt fits true to size. i love the cut of the shirt which adds some edge to a basic tee. i know i will wear this all the time throughout the fall and winter months. perfect to wear as is or layer with cardigans, jackets and scarves in cooler weather.\n",
      "Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants, but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation, so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway, since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.\n",
      "There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.\n",
      "I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t\n",
      "Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread \"xs\" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white\n",
      "Loved the print on this dress, however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly, and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous. it is somewhat fitted but i didn't find it to run small. i am top heavy 36d and usually wear a size 10, but i bought this in an 8 and it fits me great. i will say the zipper is a bit tricky. at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck. after fiddling with it, i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky. i wore it to work and got so many compliments. also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac\n",
      "This top is really cute but shorter in length than expected.  plus, it shrunk considerably!\n",
      "I got this dress today. i was super excited and hoped to use it. it runs so, so small. i'm returning and ordering up.\n",
      "This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality, even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...\n",
      "This vest is so cute and a perfect transition piece for fall. it runs a little big. i normally wear an xs, but i had to exchange for an xxs\n",
      "I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!\n",
      "Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.\r\n",
      "it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.\n",
      "As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.\n",
      "What a dress! the print, the feel of the fabric, and the overall fit of this dress, it definitely has the wow factor! i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year. i typically wear a 6 and sometimes a 4 in retailer dresses. i'm 5'6'' 130 lbs 32dd and took a 6 in this. i could probably even try the 8. it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but i'm not sure if it warranted a size up. it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxi's yet.\n",
      "The quality is good, as is the design idea, but, practically, it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy, it is stiff and very wide.\n",
      "I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.\n",
      "Bought these for my honeymoon to hawaii- they will be perfect for lounging. very comfy, but a little see through so likely not to wear on their own.\n",
      "Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!\n",
      "This fits great. it looks great with jeans or exercise pants. a little lighter weight than i hoped but looks great, hangs well on my body. i bought the white.\n",
      "This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.\n",
      "Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person\n",
      "I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4\", 130 and ordered the 6.\n",
      "The jeans are flatering and stylish. they are slightly distressed but will go with anything. the fit is like other pilcro stet pants i've purchased and loved.\n",
      "Have not worn them yet, but they are so soft and pretty. seems like a good item to travel with.\n",
      "Very flattering tee. nice details & quality.\r\n",
      "my first time purchasing this brand, but will look for similar items from them.\n",
      "This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle, not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top, there is a lot of fabric, but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!\n",
      "I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.\n",
      "I reallllly love this sweater! i could wear it every day if i could. the sweater is comfortable, lightweight (but not see through) and versatile.\n",
      "I loved the way this top fit and i am a total sucker for floral prints. i took my normal medium (5'5\" 150lb). unfortunately the material was very thin, scratchy and had a horrible chemical smell. back it went.\n",
      "I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3\" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear\n",
      "This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack, so it's going back.\n",
      "I'm wearing this shirt right now. i'm usually a large in tops. i bought a medium and i'm kinda wishing i got a small instead. it's very swingy. its super cute but size down at least one size maybe two\n",
      "This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with, it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.\n",
      "This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and, in fact, recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat, i washed the top in a\n",
      "I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye, and the woven back. the cut is boxy, but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans\n",
      "I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look \"frumpy\". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3\", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.\n",
      "This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy, cozy, but still stylish. i love it.\n",
      "Comfy, casual, and stylish! i received many compliments on this shirt. it drapes across your body very nicely and does not cling. it has a great asymmetrical cut that is very flattering. the material is comfortable and the color is warm and summer-like.\n",
      "I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.\n",
      "This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!\n",
      "I love this top. it comes with its own camisole. the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect.\n",
      "Love love love this shirt!  great quality .. washes / dries wonderfully!  it is loose and flowy .. it's supposed to be that way - but it lays nicely!  it's longer than pictured which i love - i'm sure i'm shorter than the model but it's truly a perfect shirt! goes great with my jean skirt.. jeans, shorts and dressier skirts.  if you get a chance to order .. don't hesitate!  :)\n",
      "Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too! it is longer on me than the model (and i'm 5'10\") and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans. i also wear a white tank underneath just in case, otherwise i think i'd be showing some skin. i like that the front and back are two different materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well, too, and during cooler seasons, i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material\n",
      "Wasn't sure about this but got the xs/s on sale. the style is very wide and is longer on me than pictured. somehow it works because it drapes nicely from my shoulders. should be comfy to wear in the summer. the two i received are a deep turquoise and will pair nicely with some of my favorite jewelry.\n",
      "This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric, it's very boxy, & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(\n",
      "I bought the m/l (5'4\",130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length, and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice.\n",
      "Love this. the stripes are cute and simple, but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank, so there is a lot of fabric, but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :)\n",
      "The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.\n",
      "Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.\n",
      "I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell, nor does it itch, as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color, but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1\", but ordered the regular xs, and i am happy with the length.\n",
      "What a great shirt. however, none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture. the front of them are all a deep blue color, no tie-dyed effect or whatever you're seeing on the online pics. the shirt runs large. i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big. i can't imagine how the larger size would have looked! i think this top will go with many things, including as a cover up over dresses.\n",
      "It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady\n",
      "I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.\n",
      "I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei\n",
      "The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a \"statement sweater\". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference, i am 5'9\", 150 lbs., 34dddd, and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and, with my height, i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks.\n",
      "I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality. this pair is no exception to that. i am 5'5\" and about 113, slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great. buying them on-line, i wasn't able to check how distressed the denim was. the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image. mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg. onl\n",
      "I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.\n",
      "Very attractive and well fitting. absolutely recommend it.\n",
      "I didn't expect the fit to be as cute, i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top, but untucked, or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person, still light turquoise, but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy, but not oversized or boxy.\n",
      "Also, does run big, though i felt te xs seemed fine (usual size is xs). passed as there were better options, runs big,but mostly, it was scratchy. beautiful color and design, however.\n",
      "This is a cute sweater that can be very versatile. i love to wear it to work with a dress pant as well as with jeans on the weekends. it is soft and looks great on. would recommend.\n",
      "I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase. i can still zip it at 27.5/28\" but would be more comfortable at say 26\". i'm almost 5'5\" and with 3\" heels it skims the floor perfectly. i'm so obsessed with the weight and texture! it is full and fabulous! i'll just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sister-in-laws wedding next month. \r\n",
      "i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly! photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy.\n",
      "This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.\n",
      "I immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower, nice fabric and medium weight. nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo, great outfit. i am happy i ordered it, but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy, sleeves long. i am 5'6 medium build. small usually fits me well.\n",
      "i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back.\n",
      "This is a great cardigan to wear buttoned or open. the fit is perfect; it is fitted and looks great with jeans, skirts or over a sleeveless dress. love the little detail of lace to show skin. fabric has lycra so it hugs your bodice just enough!! love it.\n",
      "This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.\n",
      "I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater, more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute, warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.\n",
      "This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest, which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame, what with the bold flower and the fit, so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater, this could work well for you.\n",
      "Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!\n",
      "I love this dress so much...what an excellent purchase! i wear this with white leggins and love the look. this dress has a sheath underneath the flower pattern that is form fitting, which i think is way sexy from the back. the front part of the dress is very flowy and moves nicely. i love the high neck on this piece and the beautiful colors. a wonderful pick up from retailer.\n",
      "The reason i purchased these pants is because i don't have anything like it. they are fun but nice enough to wear in the work place. well constructed, too. the only thing is they are very long. i am 5'4\" and these are probably 3-4 inches below what the picture shows. i had purchased a pair of platform shoes from retailer awhile back that will go perfect with these pants; however, i my still have to have them hemmed. other than that, they run pretty true to size. i usually wear a size 10 and the pa\n",
      "This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down. they are very flattering and runs true to size. they're also a bit highwaisted which i love. my only complaint is that they are unlined. i'm not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined. however i'm still giving them 5 stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con.\n",
      "I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!\n",
      "This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!\n",
      "The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon, unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also, the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.\n",
      "The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.\n",
      "I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.\n",
      "This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering. comfortable fit as well. love it!\n",
      "Love the colors and design, however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows, and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it.\n",
      "I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you won't be disappointed with this one.\n",
      "This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn't expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great!\n",
      "Bought this for my daughter in law's birthday. it's just a beautiful, feminine design, well made, nice fabric.. she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out. very versatile.\n",
      "This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise.\n",
      "I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!\n",
      "Wanted to love these pants, they are way, way, too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.\n",
      "Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!\n",
      "I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.\n",
      "These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise. other than that, they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting. i'm 5'6\" 107lb got a size 25 and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isn't too big just not constricting. i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it 100% plus the length is perfect\n",
      "These jeans are great, however they are very long. i am 5'4 and i should have ordered a petite size. even though i never have to buy petite size pants. wish they made these a bit shorter.\n",
      "This is a lovely dress looks very expensive, nice fabric and detail. i'm 6ft tall 160lb. i normally order a l/10 but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out. length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but then again i'm pretty tall. you can't really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment, which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric. size wise, i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized. it sits we\n",
      "I ordered the dusty pink color and love it. works well with many colors and tops. i am 5' 6\" and 121 lbs. with an athletic lean body. i do have a butt however and a small waist. i vary between a 26 and 27. ordered both because i could see this was a very slim pant. i could barely get the 26 up over my hips. the 27 fits like a glove, with just the right amount of stretch. i can't see these pants bagging after wear, which is something we all hate. love these pants and i know i will wear them often\n",
      "Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.\n",
      "This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.\n",
      "These are flattering and the colors are really nice. they're a bit tighter than other pilcro pants i've tried, but the material is stretchy.\n",
      "I love this dress! high quality dress in a classic style. the cotton eyelet detailing is my favorite part and really elevates this from just another black dress. it is a swing silhouette (as described in the product description) so there is a little more volume than a regular dress, but that's what makes it fun and breezy! great dress, can't wait to wear it when it gets a little warmer.\n",
      "I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.\n",
      "Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all, they don't stretch out over the day.   i'm 5'10, a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly.\n",
      "I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try\n",
      "I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5' 5\" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!!\n",
      "Just picked this up at the store 40% off sale price, well worth it! the petite hits perfect on my 5'3\" frame, right about where it hits the model in the pic. very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often.\n",
      "I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!\n",
      "I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!\n",
      "This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life. it's very retro-swingy and girlish- it reminds me of something mia farrow would've worn in her rosemary's baby era. i have the black version and i've paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days. i think it's a total steal at the sale price.\n",
      "I really love this rose-pink color. the pants fit like a glove. the cuff is not sewn up, so you can lower the cuff to where you like it.\n",
      "First off, the dress quality is great, the fabric is very nice, the color is great. i am 5'4\", 150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me, very unattractive, because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant.\n",
      "These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.\n",
      "I got this top in green and i'm overall happy with it. i agree with the other reviewers that the material is thin and the quality not top notch and it certainly is overpriced for what it is (especially with the shipping fee). however the style is really cute, love the lace up in the back and if flows nicely without billowing as is the case with so many retailer swing tops lately.\r\n",
      "i didn't find it to be so see through that it would need a cami (at least not the green color) and a nude strapless br\n",
      "I love this tank. i didn't find it to be see through at all. it runs true to size. it's super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top. it's a great basic and i love the lilac color.\n",
      "Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it\n",
      "I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately, the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area, but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture, i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank\n",
      "This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58.\n",
      "Out of stock so quickly in my size. please restock!\n",
      "Just got the silver ones in the mail yesterday -- really great fall pants! they are quite a bit more grey than how they look on my computer, so i was a bit surprised, but not unpleasantly.\r\n",
      " i'm one of those people who always has trouble with pants because my thighs are bigger and my waist smaller than usual. i'm 5'6\", 120 with a 26 inch waist and 38 inch hips. i ordered the 28 so my legs could fit inside the pants, but there is quite a bit of gaping at the waist meaning that i cannot go without\n",
      "The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.\n",
      "This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color, soft faded pink, which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size, i wouldn't size down because these are\"t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable.\n",
      "I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that's the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad.\n",
      "These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.\r\n",
      "i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.\r\n",
      "the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.\r\n",
      "love the braided styling around the pockets.\r\n",
      "the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.\n",
      "Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better\n",
      "Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!\n",
      "Thank goodness they had a special discount because i love this sweater. it is not normal for me to splurge but there was something about this sweater and it didn't disappoint. too cute. a great top to wear to a concert or a relaxed party. i love it.\n",
      "I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal, ha. i can't wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol\n",
      "When i tried these on in the store in my size, but thought they felt tight, but the person helping me pointed out that they hug you, but are not uncomfortable. i uncuff the bottom and wear them full-length. ended up buying one of each color.\n",
      "I got the green one. as the other reviewers commented, yes, the fabric is thin. however, i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and i've had nothing but compliments!\n",
      "I really like this shirt. i almost didn't order it based on the other reviews, but its cute and comfortable! i didn't get the white color, so that may be why mine is not see through. i just wear it with a bra and its good to go!\n",
      "I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!\n",
      "I love this dress, and on sale it's a total steal. it's true to size, and beyond comfortable! i live in az so i can easily wear this year round. i got the black color and love it. i'm 5'4\" and it hits a little above my knees. love the loose, feminine swing. i feel like skipping wearing this dress :)\n",
      "I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!\n",
      "I loved this top. i paired it with he ag stevie short and jasper and jeera beaded sandals. look was super cute and casual. i love the fact you can adjust the fit in the back with the lace up detailing. flowly tank without the maternity look. i went with the lavender color and it looks great with my olive skin. i had no problem with sheerness when wearing a nude bra. for reference i am 5'6'' 132 lbs and went with the small.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.\n",
      "I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time, and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe, as pictured, so if you're looking for true grey, this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3\" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!\n",
      "I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w\n",
      "These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to \"bag out\" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref, i'm 5'2\" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very comfortable, but ran small. great quality and great look.\n",
      "The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.\n",
      "Top feels like pajamas but looks very classy. the sweater material is so soft. i wear it with a blazer over the top and i get so many compliments on it. wish they had it in more colors! must have!\n",
      "These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.\n",
      "I just received these jeans. love them. i usually wear a 29- i ordered a 30 and they fit great. they are too long- will need to be hemmed. but the fit is great. the material is soft. lovely. great buy.\n",
      "This top is comfortable and yet with some stylish detail. the fabric is soft and the lilac color looks great. it hangs loose but with a nice drape. at the sale price it is not to be missed.\n",
      "Yes, it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft, the colors are great, and the hood, well, the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.\n",
      "Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again, but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream \"look at me\" (let's be honest, there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi\n",
      "I like how styling and comfortable it is, i bought it in both colors. definitely a nice piece for fall/winter in this houston weather.\n",
      "When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however, when i examined it and proceeded to try it on, i was really disappointed. the quality is ok, but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d,109lbs, 5'0\"). the bottom part fit. sadly, not impressed. this one is going back :(\n",
      "Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me, a friend, and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.\n",
      "I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line \"princess\" seams in the front and back, but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.\n",
      "I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.\n",
      "The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice. the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers. would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress!\n",
      "I have loved this dress from the first time i saw it. but the price scared me away until a sale came to be that meant i could justify buying it. honestly it's worth it's original price, i'm just too much of a scrooge to pay it! the details are adorable. the length makes it very versatile. it seems well made and pretty weighty. fits nicely due to the elastic in the back; i got an 8.. i weigh 170, 5'8\" with a small chest. most of the dresses i buy are just as much art as they are fashion and this\n",
      "I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....\n",
      "This poncho is lovely. i found it fits perfectly. im 5'4\", 125 and got the xs/s..just long enough (loke jacket length) and the hood doesnt add extra weight (doesnt drag it down the back). arm holes are approriate size. very cool piece for any weather layering.\n",
      "The appliquã© on this dress is well done. i would recommend it to anyone. the design is super flattering and feminine.\n",
      "Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7\" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i\n",
      "This is great just to have and throw on.it is a everyday piece.\n",
      "Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.\n",
      "I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge, because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9\", so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the \"laid flat width\" was included maybe that would have been more helpful, but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist, enhancing that effect. i loved the\n",
      "I love this poncho because it's the perfect weight and it is softer than i thought it would be. i will get a lot of use out of it. getting it on sale made it even better.\n",
      "I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable, stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.\n",
      "This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.\n",
      "I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...\n",
      "This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical \"mom pajama\" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!\n",
      "This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.\n",
      "I've been wanting a higher-waisted, button-front skirt. this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim.. it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a business-casual setting. i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons. i'm normally a 0 or 2 in dresses (5'6, 118 lbs) and i ordered a 0 in the skirt, as the natural waist is a little on the large side. i love it!\n",
      "The design is loose and forgiving, and it is very comfortable. the fabric is soft and light weight, and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them! it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on. you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great go-to top on the weekend. i also bought the purple version - it says it's mauve in the description, but it's really more of a pale lavender color. still very pretty, but i wish it was mauve!\n",
      "Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4, but have curvy hips, so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line, but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall, cute design, but not for me.\n",
      "Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.\n",
      "I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.\n",
      "...for real, reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.\n",
      "I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.\n",
      "This runs way big, i'm a size 8, purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.\n",
      "I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos, because of the wrap style, the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem, though if you lift your arms, your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small\n",
      "It's is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it's truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.\n",
      "I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of\n",
      "This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!\n",
      "I bought the green motif and the colors are beautiful and look just like the picture. as others have mentioned, it does have a high slit on the side that has a tendency to separate and look bulky. i just put a couple of small hooks to keep it together. i normally would wear a medium or large, but based on other reviews, i ordered down to the small and it was perfect. since i live in the south where it can stay quite warm through fall, it will be a great transitional piece.\n",
      "I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!\n",
      "I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste, but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami, but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets, so i'm not terribly concerned.\n",
      "I love this poncho. i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting!\n",
      "Love the draping on this top - covers the stomach area, and looks great on curvy girls.\r\n",
      "i am between sizes, and ended up purchasing the m. fits well. i chose the mauve, which is more of a light gray/purple.\n",
      "Classic retailer stunning dress! the embroidery is beautiful, with the beads and details. the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion, but i didn't have trouble with this. i got a ton of compliments. it looks a bit flat on top on the model. i'm not very curvy, and it accentuates my curves nicely. it doesn't hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture, but has a more classic fit and flare shape, very flattering.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !\n",
      "Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels, as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3\" petite. so, it doesn't swallow me\n",
      "I have been looking for a button-down denim skirt that would be short enough for me, and was glad to see that this one came in a petite. i ordered it in a 2p and a 4p with plans to return the one that didn't fit. 99% of the time, one of these sizes will fit me. in this case, however, even the 2p was slightly too big. i'm going to exchange for a 0p. for anyone who normally wears a 0, you might want to pass on this, as it will probably be too big.\r\n",

      "on the plus side, it's quite lightweight and so\n",

      "I have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one. it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think it's more flattering (at least on me it is). i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size. i usually wear a 4 but a 2 fit great and it's been a long time since i've worn a 2!\n",
      "Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.\n",

      "I normally wear a 4, and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated, my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..\n",
      "I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.\n",

      "This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an \"easy\" look. i've already worn this with a dress, and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6\", 138 lbs and took a medium.\n",

      "Love the print so much!! it is a bit boxy, but for the length i needed to size up to a s from my usual xs with my long torso at 5'7\", 111lbs. i'm thinking that sizing up will also save me from any potential dryer accidents. but it doesn't really matter what size you get-just get it for the cute print scene!!\n",
      "This is a great dress that i wear to work, but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding. it rides up a tiny but, but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable. it is tiny up top so i'd recommend ordering up if you have any chest - i'm 5'4\", 100lbs, bra size 32b and it was a two-person job to get the bodice zipped.\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo, i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs, and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.\n",

      "I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition, the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues, i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k\n",
      "I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.\n",
      "This dress is really beautiful. i was looking for something to wear to a summer 6 o'clock wedding, and this dress will work perfectly. the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal. however, you can easily dress it down. my only issue was the length. i'm 5'4 and this dress was way too long. definitely need to take off about 5 or 6 inches! i also had to size up. i could have tried the petite, but it fit so well everywhere except length,\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price.\n",
      "I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe, and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.\n",

      "I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.\n",
      "Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4\"\n",
      "Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.\n",
      "I thought it would have been heavier, surprised it was so thin but it works. i live in the deep south so it doesn't get that cold. i wore it to dinner with a black top and jeans, it was super cute. i'm happy with my purchase.\n",

      "it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.\n",

      "Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.\n",

      "Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7\") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes, but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size, do size up.\n",
      "This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle, but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes, it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!\n",
      "I find that every year (or two at the most) i have to find a new favorite black dress or two (fading, etc.), and, this is definitely one of those dresses for this year (almost one to buy another, so i have one that looks good in a year or two)! the dress is all around flattering and comfortable... looks wonderful with high heels and flats, looks good at work and while out having fun! probably won't be able to count how many times i wear it this year!\n",
      "I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos, so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7\", 130, straight/slender build), so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit, size down. either way, get this!!!!\n",
      "I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however, the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end, i decided to return it:(\n",

      "This is an eye-catching top and cute design. the xs fit but was extra-billowy for my taste...if you notice on the model it also shows that the back is not fitted and flows behind wider than is normal...a great and breezy style, but for me, sadly it overwhelmed my short frame. the bottom of the ruffle hit me just at the hips which made the top also a tad too short for my taste. i am sure on others it will work and look amazing.\n",
      "So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)\n",
      "I just got this top today. the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web. it is so incredibly soft and comfortable. i tried it on and it fits just like the photo. i am 5'8 so i can get away with the blousy effect, but, i think that is part of why it is so charming. i think you could dress it up or down really well. i am really pleased.\n",
      "This dress is so flattering, not the usual type of dress i go for, but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down, if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.\n",
      "This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.\n",
      "Bought this in store yesterday, light fit and extremely comfortable! i'm 5'4 135 and have a long torso, so i ended up going with a large in this one because i like my shirts to hang loose. print is more vivid in person but nonetheless a great but!\n",

      "Nice dress, you can wash it, i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect, \r\n",
      "brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material. \r\n",
      "material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving. \r\n",
      "i will be returning it for that reason, too heavy for summer .\n",
      "I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.\n",
      "These are really great fitting pants. they are perfect for work. i noticed a little stretch throughout the day but just the perfect amount. the only draw back is that after wearing them once, i noticed a 6 inch opening at the seam of the back leg. i had to get the tailor to fix them. they need to work on the seams in the future.\n",
      "Confused and a little disappointed because the s is too tight in my shoulders and the m is too big all around.  weird because i'm a 39\" chest+breasts so m shouldn't look that baggy on me.  please sanctuary, make a petite version, maybe that will solve my issue.  otherwise, this jacket is soft and relaxed and has no distracting collar.  price point is bit over indulgent for what it is combined with my issues.  who knows, maybe i'll try again?!?\n",
      "Ok you had me at the western scene. soft and comfortable. true to size. you can dress it up or down. just a great t shirt. recommend it! get it!!\n",
      "Cute sweatshirt with fun print. i bought it using retailer discount, and probably would not have paid full price for it. embroidery is a nice touch. i ordered an xs, which fits fine, but the overall design of the shirt is a little short and boxy. i did not realize until it arrived that the back of the shirt is a v neck. it's not a deep v, but it feels a little odd at first.\n",
      "Love this top. the material is light, soft and comfortable. one thing to note. it runs very large? this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middle?this style would not look good if it didn't fit loose?..so i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of room?.something i need for my full figure. if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two.\n",
      "Maybe i'm hanging out with my grandson too much because this appealed to the kid in me!  looks great under a jean jacket and under a leather jacket - oh, and cool under a silk bomber jacket as well.\n",
      "Light weight jacket, perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile, - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made, fold cuffs back for the classic look.\n",
      "I saw this and the \"giddy up\" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in\n",
      "This is just as cute in person. i wear it with black jean shorts, boyfriend jeans, washed out jeans like the model, or khakis. the colors are great and so is the fit. love it.\n",
      "I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me, this dress fit terribly. however, the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3\" and about 117 with a really short torso, and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller, or maybe with a longer torso, i could see this dress being really lovely.\n",
      "I purchased this blouse over the summer and it's very pretty. i love the cap sleeves with the lace and the detail in the front. it can be dressed up or dressed down, my only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily.\n",
      "This is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it (delicate, cold water, line dry) it shrunk excessively in length. i'm very disappointed.\n",
      "This top fit nicely and was tts, but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.\n",
      "Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online, but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!\n",
      "This jacket is adorable.. it is very flattering and different. can easily be dressed up for work or dressed down as shown. note: it is unlined and very light weight. these are huge selling points for me as it makes the jacket seasonless. love it!!!\n",
      "I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top, so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft, one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.\n",
      "This shirt runs boxy, but the print is as cute as it looks online\n",
      "Cozy. soft. comfortable. a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personality..it's a unique fabric design that makes you feel like you're on vacation ..love it.\n",
      "This blouse if very pretty and feminine. i agree with the other reviews that said it emphasizes the size of your hips. i don't have any so it was great for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "This top is very interesting, has delicate knitting pattern, feels very soft but also very thin. i ordered a purple size large, and it was true to size, but a little shorter in the body than looks, sleeves are long just as other reviewers have mentioned. i am 6ft tall, 160lb and i have long torso & curvy body, so this sweater turned out to be shorter than i hoped but with all that underneath layering it could be manageable. overall look of the sweater is about the same as the photo, the only mat\n",
      "Perfect! awesome! i have a few of these now and love them. they do stretch a little so i wouldn't size up. i'm about 138 pounds and 5'8'' and normally m. i wear the 27 in these.\n",
      "This pullover is a great purchase. the color is simply stunning and is very comfortable.\n",
      "I bought this jacket in green and it is beautiful. the green is a true\n",
      "forest green. sizing is accurate. my only wish is that they offered more colors and the snaps were double faced so you could snap the collar back.\n",
      "I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8\" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big.\n",
      "I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.\n",
      "I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b\n",
      "I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8\" curvy 32dd\n",
      "I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me. this sweater is really flattering! i chose the grey colored one. i'm smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft.\n",
      "I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1\", 113 lb, and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t\n",
      "This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit, but is much warmer than i was expecting. the periwinkle color is gorgeous. the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit\n",
      "Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.\n",
      "It's hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy, but doesn't look bulky. this sweater does it all. it is delicate looking and soft and flattering. it is also surprisingly warm. i wear it with jeans for everyday, but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such. i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me (blond and fair). i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale. i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters.\n",
      "I loved this jacket! it's exactly what i was looking for. i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits. this definitely fit the bill! in addition, it's really soft and not at all itchy, which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online. i have received a bunch of compliments! i definitely recommend it!\n",
      "This top comes in 4 lovely colors, too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone (purple), though i might have gotten away with the silvery grey.\n",
      "fit: nice falttering line, flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist, so if you ahve a problem area, nice coverage.\n",
      "feel: super soft - nuff said ;-)\n",

      "the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived, new in the packages, with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin, as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area\n",
      "This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!\n",
      "This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!\n",
      "Dare i say, this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet. the pattern is beautiful, with green, black, and grey. the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable. the best yet!\n",
      "This sweater is very pretty. the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is. i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring. the shape is very figure flattering as well. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. \r\n",

      "I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.\n",
      "I love this pretty sweater. i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs. the length was perfect- just below the hips. the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit. this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants. the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special.\n",
      "This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.\n",
      "i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.\n",

      "1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one, but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached, or \"knotted\" in one place, and that is not the case). disappointing. \r\n",

      "So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : )\n",
      "I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty\n",
      "I really love the way this sweater fits. the only negative is that it fits rather tight on the shoulders?i have broad shoulders and the sweater fits fine when my arms are down but a little tight when i raise them. but the size small fit well everywhere else, so i'm keeping it. the orange color is pretty but kind of glows a bit, but wish i'd also gotten it in the blue-green. very pretty and feminine, great with pants or skirts. i'm usually a small or medium (often just for shoulders) but got this\n",
      "I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however, not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming, which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. let's hope i'm wrong and that it lasts!\n",
      "Omg! so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all! i wish the blue print was still available in my size. tried them on at the store and fell in love! they say the length is 31.5, however i am on the tall side, usually wear 34\" in jeans, but these are perfect. i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while. please don't change them, and i will be getting another pair or two next year!!!\n",
      "I tried on a dressing room full of items before christmas, and this was the clear winner. i got it in the green xs, which fit perfectly. i am 5'6\" and of medium build. the s was slightly too big through the chest and arms - skewed a little too military looking for me. i like the versatility of leaving it open or zipping it up, but like another reviewer, i wish the top lapel would snap back onto the shoulder because it can flop back and that gets a little annoying. overall, i really like the fitt\n",
      "1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.\n",

      "2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.\n",

      "\n",
      "it runs a bit large. i normally wear size medium for tops from retailer, but the size s of this sweater fits better than size m. the sleeves are bit long than other sweaters, but i think that's the style, as shown on the model.\n",

      "if you like feminine and romantic tops/sweaters, you will like this piece. :)\n",
      "I love this pullover. i felt it was a little wide at the bottom but i received lots of compliments on it. i ordered a large because i did not want it tight around the bust (i wear a 36j bra) and biceps but i think i would have been fine in a medium.\n",
      "I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!\n",
      "For years i've eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings. every single year in every single incredibly cool print - i've always wanted them. finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print, and i'm so glad i did. these are dreamy! they are so stretchy and so comfortable! they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit, but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue. the print is my favorite part. the colors are extremely fun, but still classy enough to not feel to\n",
      "Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material, wool, is substantial and of good quality. however, on my 5'1\", 120lb athletic frame, i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me, but all gone.\n",
      "Love that it is light and very comfortable. i got both colors, the only thing is it's dry clean only. love that i got it on sale!\n",
      "Beautifully cut and styled!its versatile and can be paired with trousers or a skirt\n",
      "I ordered this top in the purple color and was pleasantly surprised that it was more of a soft periwinkle. the weave is quite open and sheer which is what i had hoped for. the fit is great and the bottom flows quite flatteringly. overall the sweater is soft and very feminine, but careful, it snags easily.\n",
      "Flattering even for a 50+ year old body. the lavender is subtle and pretty (it's a blue-ish color) and the sweater skims the body nicely. i have a broad back and some delicate sweaters make me look unwieldy; this one is minimizing. sleeves are long, but not too much so. i usually wear an 8 and the m fits well.\n",

      "This is simply the most lovely, interesting, flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!\n",
      "This top is comfortable and pretty plus, i like the extra length in the sleeves. it is very lightweight and i'm cold natured so, i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth.\n",
      "I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly, the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.\n",
      "This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness, i had to say no. i will watch for sale.\n",
      "I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece, when i spotted this very attractive, well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium, true to size; i am an 8 top, 5'1\"130#, 34f. although i largely buy online, sometimes you ju\n",
      "I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season. i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate, and you can still tuck it in. the length is perfect. the colors are awesome. t paired it with a pair of pilco cords. it easily work with a skirt or dress pants.\r\n",
      "i would highly recommend!!!\n",
      "I didn't end up keeping this, and i feel like i might regret it. ;) i have a similar sweater. this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit. the bummer for me was that it didn't have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped, so the flaps seemed to flop around. the s was perfect. not too tight. i'm 5'8\", 140 lbs, 34c.\n",
      "This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.\n",
      "I needed a pink dress for a local breast cancer awareness luncheon. this is a perfect fit for the occasion!\n",
      "This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small), though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall, it is really very flowing and lovely on, with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.\n",
      "Great, easy to wear wrap dress. rich colors are fabulous for fall. the contrasting knit back adds just the right touch to make the dress more interesting as compared to your typical paisley print dress. i ended up with a petite as the length seemed more flattering and the bust line fit better than the regular.\n",
      "I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red, but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit, flirty, flattering, very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned, the fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment, no biggie, i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering, chest area not too snug, and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs, 26.5 in\n",
      "I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.\n",
      "I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5\" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai\n",
      "This is a lovely, light coverup with a beautiful pattern, however, in the catalogue it appears blush pink when in reality it is white. the model must be wearing a pinkish swimsuit underneath the caftan giving it the allusion of being a color which it is not. i still like it enough to keep it but am disappointed that the item description did not mention this optical illusion.\n",
      "Love this dress! it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up.\n",
      "Received this dress, the sleeves are very pretty, the drape was just what i was looking for, but the overall dress was not very flattering on me. i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way. i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on. this one had to go back\n",
      "Perfect! can't believe how inexpensive this is for the look. it looks just like it does on the model. i can't wait to wear it on my vacation.\n",
      "I first spotted this on an retailer employee, she paired it with a peasant top & wore it open w/jeans & boots- so darn cute. love how this peice transitions from summer to fall. i'm 5'4\" so i had to order the small petite which is perfect. note that this dress is very long! it's just a must have garment. the colors/ print are just beautiful.\n",
      "Saw this in the store in pink....very cool dress but i want black so i'm ordering it. the fabric was almost lace-like & it comes w a slip. it was sort of swingy, and designed to be a-line. loved it. the bell sleeves totally make it.\n",
      "This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p, and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent, and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!\n",
      "I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite\n",
      "This dress is lovely. feels like a dream...so comfortable and the lining is silky soft. i feel it runs a little large (as maeve has been this spring/summer) as i ordered a p0 and p2...the p0 fit (i am 5'4\" about 118#.) i ordered the white hoping to take it on a beach vacation. it was just a little too delicate for my needs...i have two younger children. it seemed to be easy to snag or to make a hole in the more delicate woven areas of the dress. otherwise i really liked this dress a lot. too bad\n",
      "I ordered a large and it was skin tight, if that's the look you're going for..\n",
      "This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight. it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work. i am 5'3 (and a half!) and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels. this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels.\n",
      "When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair\n",
      "Color is beautiful, fits perfectly, lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.\n",
      "This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?\n",
      "I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.\r\n",
      "yes, it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway. \r\n",
      "the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.\r\n",
      "i am 5'4 size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.\n",
      "I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up.\n",
      "This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.\n",
      "I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online, but i also have a hard time trusting retailer's online photos by their color and angle etc. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i took a gamble and, for the most part, it paid off. i do like the jacket's unique bohemian gone chic/uptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back. what i don't like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs. i feel like there might be one too many ideas, or they could have been toned\n",
      "\n",
      "I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.\n",
      "I debated whether or not to order this dress. i love the cut and style, but i was afraid the color would not work for me. with dark hair and pale skin, yellow tends to wash me out. i was correct, but the dress was adorable. definitely size down. i usually wear a medium or 8 in retailer dresses, but based on other reviews, i ordered this in a small. might could have used an extra small. this dress certainly won't show off those 10 pounds you lost, but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy. als\n",
      "I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.\n",
      "I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it's cute, but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews.\n",
      "I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.\n",
      "Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!\n",
      "I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4\", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium.\n",
      "I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!\n",
      "I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.\n",
      "I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)\n",
      "I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple.\n",
      "Runs a little small, but is very chic!!! you can wear it with jeans and a white t-shirt and you are going to look awesome!!!\n",
      "I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9\" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy, and is a bit warm for indoors, but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10\". usually a small, but sized up to a medium with this one.\n",
      "I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.\n",
      "The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.\n",
      "I bought this shirt in a size small. it fits the same as it does on the model. it's a comfortable cute shirt. wish the other colors were available because i'd order another one.\n",
      "Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.\n",
      "This product is amazing. i love that it's comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it's very versatile and i love it.\n",
      "I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow, not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy, though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to\n",
      "And lovely color, just not on my pale skin hue unfortunately. i tried on the xs in store, and that was a little long on me, so i would need petite. the cut was very flattering, and super feminine, i love the color and pattern on the dr4ess too. sadly, not for me, i looked sick in it. (115 lbs, 30 dd and xs petite would fit)\n",
      "\n",
      "This top was very pretty when i got it, but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice, and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.\n",
      "Ordered this in the white/gray. likely one of the softest tops i own, and drapes beautifully. density of fabric enough that i won't need a tee underneath. design of the pointed front will look great with a shorter jacket. i'm busty and there is a ton of fabric in the front. due to shipping i won't return but could have gone a size down, and i'm a 42dd.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.\n",
      "Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!\n",
      "Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent\n",
      "Cute print on both sides, but far more \"cheek\" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.\n",
      "Loved this as soon as i saw it. definitely darker than the photo; not as muted. since it was a jacket and i'd be wearing something under it, i chose a medium rather than the small i generally wear. the shoulders just fit and the rest was big making me look large. not a flattering fit and a major disappointment. nice that it works for the other reviewers but not for me. sadly, going back. the sweater shown underneath also runs loose and large so i'm exchanging that one for a small.\n",
      "Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft, cute design but not flattering. returning\n",
      "Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.\n",
      "I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.\n",
      "Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t\n",
      "Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'\n",
      "Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple.\n",
      "This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. \r\n",
      "touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. \r\n",
      "although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. \r\n",
      "just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.\n",
      "I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.\n",
      "This dress is happy! it is easy to wear and it is lined. it came in the mail super wrinkled tho. i went for the color more than the style and while the style is lovely, i fell in love with another retailer dress in the same color so i may return this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!\n",
      "This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!\n",
      "I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).\r\n",
      "it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6\").\r\n",
      "if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.\r\n",
      "it has pockets too btw :)\r\n",
      "this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!\n",
      "I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.\n",
      "I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.\n",
      "I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.\n",
      "When i saw this jacket in store, i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3\" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc\n",
      "Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.\n",
      "I like this shirt and think its very feminine.\n",
      "I am wearing a medium in the photos, my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.\n",
      "This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...\n",
      "I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium\n",
      "i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.\n",
      "it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works\n",
      "Very soft and lovely t-shirt. beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck. i am 140 lbs and 5' 4\" and got a large.\n",
      "I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a \"t\".\r\n",
      "it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well.\n",
      "I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6\" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well.\n",
      "Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als\n",
      "I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8\" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!\n",
      "I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.\n",
      "Will be cute in the summer months and with a pair of sweater tights will work for holiday parties. doesn't seem to come in a petite which is a bummer so i sized down.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!\n",
      "Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!\n",
      "This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i\n",
      "I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area.\n",
      "Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.\r\n",

      "Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(\n",
      "I purchased this dress in pink. it is absolutely beautiful. the shimmery detail around the neck is gorgeous! it is so flattering and looks amazing with boots or sandals! this dress will not disappoint!!\n",
      "Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments\n",
      "I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!\n",
      "I love this dress! would like to see one.september make it in sky like their meda lace top. runs a little big. i normally wear a l but the m fit perfectly.\n",
      "I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.\n",
      "I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass, ladies.\n",
      "Cute but classy top because of the embroidery at the bottom!\n",
      "I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??\n",
      "I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it's usually from a return.\n",
      "\n",
      "This duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth. looks nice over dress, jeans, crops. just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit. best part of the duster....it has pockets!! i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go!\n",
      "I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.\r\n",

      "- the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,\n",
      "I love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward. the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows. i think i might have to return it :(\n",
      "I got this shirt in black, and it's perfect for the office. i ordered a medium, which i thought was a little on the larger side. well made, the details make it an interesting top.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.\n",
      "When i walked into the store, this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight, not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans, skirts or shorts.\n",
      "This jacket is well made and the fit is perfect. it is quilted and will work well three seasons of the year. it goes with jeans, cords and flannel, and would work with skirts and dresses. colors are a bit more muted and darker than my display shows, but only slightly. studs and black trim really punch up the look of this jacket. i am very pleased with it!\n",
      "Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.\n",
      "Got the mustard and grey. very cute. looking forward to wearing it\n",
      "I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i can't wait to wear it! i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal. like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine. it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size 10 figure perfectly (i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me). the medium length was perfect for my height (5\"6).\n",
      "Just received this dress in the mail and i'm in love.  it's beautiful and fits so well.  i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but i'm so happy that i did.  ??\n",
      "I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.\n",
      "I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!\n",
      "This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.\n",
      "Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.\n",
      "I tend to like grey, black simple clothes with a splash here and there for everyday. this will be perfect in the fall/winter. it is wool, so be prepared for the felted wool feel, but it is casual comfortable. i am 5' 4\" and boxy. the medium is still roomie on me but that is how i like it.\n",
      "The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.\n",
      "I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.\n",
      "Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!\n",
      "The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.\n",
      "These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.\n",
      "This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! \r\n",
      "it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.\n",
      "These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!\n",
      "Beautiful dress; however, the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.\n",
      "I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it\n",
      "Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.\n",
      "Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more \"rustic\" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit\n",
      "I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though, very soft, lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either, which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too, and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine, while not being overly \"precious\". it does run small by a whole size, which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a\n",
      "I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't \"heavy\" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!\n",
      "This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.\n",
      "I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online, but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo, still a type of ivory, but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking, but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit, but for the price and fabric, i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.\n",
      "I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however, the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.\n",
      "Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.\n",
      "I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.\n",
      "These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.\n",
      "These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.\n",
      "I love this sweater. it's warm, comfortable, and soft. nice quality too.\n",
      "This dress looked so cute on the model, but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style, rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4\"\r\n",

      "This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on, an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.\n",
      "Love this romper! very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour, it's not sheer and undergarments won't show through. a forgiving fit for everyone\n",
      "These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.\n",
      "Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0\" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.\n",
      "The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.\n",
      "I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!\n",
      "I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small, which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be \"flowy\" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute, but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.\n",
      "This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.\n",
      "Such a pretty little sweater, gorgeous detail. i wish it were a bit longer, it was too boxy for my large chest. otherwise it fits tts. i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap. so comfortable. please make more sweaters in this knit!\n",
      "And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.\r\n",

      "Comfortable, stretchy fabric. i ordered the xs and will probably take the sides in at least a couple of inches for a snugger fit...the fit is looser than it looks on the model.\n",

      "This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough, unflattering shape, too masculine, too boring, too wrinkly, or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter, but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple, plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me, year round. i have other cloth & stone tops, and have loved them all. their\n",
      "Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!\n",

      "This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy, comfortable, stylish, and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down, the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red, but i think you could wear black boots with it, no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!\n",
      "I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.\n",
      "I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change\n",
      "This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,\n",

      "I'm 5'3\" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped.\n",
      "First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.\n",
      "I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. \r\n",

      "I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i\n",

      "I found this to be a comfortable, stylish, no-fuss look. bought my normal size 4 (5'7\", 128#) in the orange, and it fits like the model. it's a nice lightweight linen and is machine washable, which is always a plus. you can't tell from the photo, but the lace-up portion actually has a bit of fabric in it, so you aren't revealed if it isn't tightly laced ;)\n",
      "I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!\n",
      "I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however, the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus, it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.\n",
      "I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.\n",
      "Pretty top. quality material, it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy, if you don't size down, the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.\n",
      "This top was really cute on someone else, but not on me... on me, ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too, just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season, it is a bit boxy, but looks nice with jeans, white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...\n",
      "When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5\"). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!\n",
      "I am normally a size m, sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs, but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(\n",
      "I ordered this dress in 0p since i am 5ft. it fits great its not too short just above the knee.\n",
      "Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was \"hanging out\"\n",
      "I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.\n",

      "When this appeared on line, i thought t would be a sure thing, color (blue), cut and style, this dress appeared to have been made for me, but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5\" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a\n",

      "This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.\n",
      "I ordered the black and white pattern, which was ok. i got a small, but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.\n",

      "Loved this blouse the moment i tried it on! it is one of \"those\" items for me. it does run large so size down. if you are concerned about the arms don't be. i usually go between a medium and large and the medium was perfectly roomy without being to large.\n",
      "Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.\n",
      "I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant \"i'm buyi\n",
      "I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d\n",
      "Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.\n",
      "This top is soft, comfortable and drapes nicely. the print makes it fresh and different. i sized down to a small.\n",
      "Perfect fit shirt. super cute and very comfortable. i purchased a size xl at first but it was too large, l fit perfect. i'm normally a size 14 on top, but this runs large.\n",
      "The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40.\n",
      "I am short (5'3\") and very curvy. i usually get petite in dresses. something about this fit was strange. it was definitely a little shorter than most petites. the lace detail on the front of this dress is really cute and it is a color you don't see often so i kept it.\n",
      "This top is gorgeous in person, but when i tried it on, i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately, but the more i wore it around the fitting room area, the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8\", 140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes, it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.\n",
      "A great white blouse! i expected this top to be sheer and yet it's quite opaque. i bought the white in a size small, i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering. relaxed yet super polished look.\n",
      "I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).\n",
      "Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.\n",
      "This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons\n",
      "This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.\n",
      "Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.\n",
      "I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the\n",
      "I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.\n",
      "This is why i shop at retailer. i was in one of my local stores recently, mainly to check out the sale. my boyfriend was with me. we hadn't been in the store 5 minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees. this one caught my eye. the color, omg! and then flowers and butterflies! try it on, he said, as i held one up. no..... i shouldn't. we wandered around, checked out the sale and all the new. and i was back at that table looking at that tee. so, i took a small and an xs to the fitting\n",
      "I received this dress yesterday and it exceeded expectations! i was not expecting the fabric to have a slight stretch and felt that the fabrication aided to the overall comfort of the dress without losing any of the quirky elegance. due to the stretch, however, i immediately ordered a size down for comparison. i'm a pretty solid 2 with eva franco dresses but with this cut i had about an inch of fabric in the waist. regardless, i'm keeping the dress - jury is just still out on which side!! measur\n",
      "I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!\n",
      "This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.\n",
      "Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!\r\n",
      "will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.\r\n",

      "looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!\n",
      "I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!\n",
      "Have had many compliments on this tee! feels dressed up without feeling too fancy\n",
      "I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.\n",
      "This product is made of good-quality cotton material. it does run a little large, but it still fits nicely. i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment.\n",
      "I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it. it's so flattering and well constructed, if a little longer than i usually prefer. i'll just have to wear pumps with it. i don't have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress. it does have pockets, also. i ordered the 12 and it fits beautifully. for reference i have a 40\" bust and 33\" waist.\n",
      "I just want you guys to be aware that the red print is not short sleeved! we have this in store and both are 3/4 length sleeves! great material and fit.\n",
      "I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.\n",
      "I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just what i wanted. a simple design (so many of retailer's suits have way too much going on) and this one fit the bill. sexy, strappy and clean. i can't wait to live in this top this summer.\n",
      "So happy to say this dress was built for my body type.  i'm heavier & wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodice/halter fits perfectly and comfortably.  going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft a-line, the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty.  yes, the fabric is heavier weight, so i wouldn't recommend wearing in hot & humid weather.  i love the unique print & colors!  i do not own anything in this color combination.  the retro vibe is strong in this one so i\n",
      "I got the red, which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute, but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return, but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)\n",
      "I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!\n",

      "This top runs very large and is loose fitting in the middle. it looks very flattering and is very comfortable. i bought the one in red and it looks quite good. i would go down one size, maybe two.\n",

      "This shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent. this shirt runs ridiculously large. purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl. no impressed with the pattern in person. looks cheap. will be returning.\n",

      "Really pretty blue top. great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door, of if you have to run a quick errand! if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe. the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color. don't get me wrong. the top is casual and cute. it is not sloppy and has an international, worldly vibe. i recommend it.\n",
      "I bought the dress in mango. i love the color. it is very vibrant. the fit is great and i imagine getting a lot of use out of this dress during the summer months. my only complaint is that i expected the fabric to be a little bit heavier. i find it to be kind of thin.\n",
      "I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!\n",

      "i am a curvy 4 or a 6, smaller on top, with hips. i love this fit. it it pulls in at a high waist, with a stretch in the pants---it's just adorable! i would say that the top portion is quite fitted- it's not a stretchy material, more of a textured thick fabric- so that is somethin\n",
      "The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.\r\n",

      "I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin\n",

      "The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.\r\n",

      "This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!\n",
      "...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print, colors, and design. however, i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it, the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap\n",
      "This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6\". i'm 5'9\" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it.\n",
      "A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!\n",
      "Great alternative to yoga pants, these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!\n",
      "I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly, it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable, but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine, but it is a thin sweater.\n",
      "This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!\n",
      "The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. \r\n",

      "Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin, which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.\n",
      "I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.\n",

      "Great idea, but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked, but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price, it did not justify a place in my closet?\n",

      "These jeans are amazing. they are so comfortable.  they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day. i am 5'4\" and 135 lbs and purchased  my usual size 27. i did have to have them shortened \r\n",
      "but only b/c i bought in store and did not have the petite online option. i have worn them on several occasions. great purchase.\n",
      "I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.\n",
      "These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5\" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them.\n",
      "These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.\n",
      "I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.\n",
      "Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4\" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!\n",
      "I love these bottoms they are super cute, comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.\n",
      "I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i\"m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.\n",
      "I have a hard time with skinny pants due to my muscular thighs... but these worked. the length on the petite was a tad long, but i see on the model hers do a similar thing so perhaps it is meant to be that way... would look better with heels for me (below 5'2\")\n",
      "I love it but i don't at the same time:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "sheer, so sheer, you can probably get away with a nude bra, but not sure... i tried on both colors, and love them both. love the shimmer... i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regular...i think i would go with regular, the petite seemed cropped on me, so if i lift my arms, hello belly...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "so overall, i would probably get this if it goes on sale, color is either way, but since i don't have an immediate need, i passed. nice turtleneck, though.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5\", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit\n",
      "I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!\n",
      "Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6\n",
      "Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.\n",
      "When i first received this sweater, i was a little worried about the bulk, especially the thick cables and popcorn stitches. after i got it on and adjusted it to all the right places, i would say it looks similar to the model in the photo. i did not find it itchy. the yarn is soft and airy but i guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. the length was low hip on me and i'm 5'9\" tall. overall, i'm very pleased and looking forward to wearing it. can't speak to the quality of the garment beca\n",
      "I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.\n",
      "I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!\n",
      "Me: 5'6\", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3\" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.\r\n",
      "a win!\n",
      "I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely\n",
      "It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.\r\n",
      "i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite, i'd try it.\r\n",
      "it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.\n",
      "I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous. \r\n",

      "not only does it fit well and run true to size, it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on, and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a\n",
      "I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.\n",
      "I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.\n",
      "Great fit, comfortable and stylish. easy to dress up or down, excellent item for any wardrobe.\n",
      "The tag on the jeans said \"won't stretch out\", and i've already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear. ive been wearing the smaller size for a week, and it's stretching out as well. the crotch ends up dropping two or 3 inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public, after just a week of owning them. i love paige jeans, and the cut and color of these are amazing. i'm going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up, i hope\n",
      "I love these jeans. they are flattering and don't sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.\n",
      "This darling dress has a fun boho vibe to it and the color/pattern would flatter a variety of skin tones. a long necklace is a must with this dress. it has a flowy drape below the waist so it's a generous fit. i purchased the medium.\n",
      "I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4\" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!\n",
      "I ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model...not tight at all and very flattering. even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering...makes my legs look long! i am 5'4\" and about 118#. the material is so soft and substantial...the color is very accurately portrayed online. i can't wait to wear this fall!\n",
      "I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2\" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.\n",
      "I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.\n",
      "I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to, but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the \"sagging out\" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.\n",
      "\n",
      "i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping., i am 5'3.5\" and abt 123 lbs. usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite. sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit. i ordered a sz small petite and it's perfect. super soft, great colors, perfect length!! love it!\n",
      "I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5\" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice, not as dark as the photo as others have said.\n",
      "These give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist. only negative is that being 5'4 and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me. i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always.\n",
      "These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of \"high water\" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great.\n",
      "I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me. i'm pretty short (5'2\") and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles. no hemming necessary! the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semi-empire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable. the dress is very stretchy but doesn't look like it. it is absolutely one of my \"summer staples\" now - especially for traveling. if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would.\n",
      "These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are\n",
      "Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.\n",
      "They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.\n",
      "These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160, which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length, and the size 32 was bigger than i need, but not too big. these are very classy looking, and go with sandals to booties for every type of look, summer to winter,  with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.  \r\n",
      "the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;\n",
      "This is like wearing an afghan, but i get cold really easy so for me that's a good thing. and it's super soft and not itchy. i could easily never take this off. runs a little large, but that should be fine when it gets layered. ...only thing i didn't like was the one long stitch that holds the wrap in place. i worry it will snap and the whole thing will unravel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sits slightly below waist, i bought size 30p, length is good no alteration required for petite height 5'4 and 136lb. material is good and i recommend them.\n",
      "These are super comfortable and with heels can be very flattering. i like the fact that you can wear them with or without the belt. \r\n",
      "however i wish that the color was the same darkness as shown online. they are lighter and a bit duller. i look at a few pairs and they are all the same. still love them but i'm sure they would have been even more fantastic if they looked like the picture.\n",
      "I have a tough time shopping for jeans because almost everything that fits my butt is too big in the waist. also, i have thick thighs so that's an issue and i hate shopping for jeans. these are so much cuter on than on the hanger. try them. you won't regret it. so flattering.\n",
      "I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe, especially when paired with a dressier top, blazer, skinny belt and heels. also, i like that the jeans don't have the to\n",
      "I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of \"mostly\" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(\n",
      "I am a huge fan of all things \"mother\" brand now. they fit great and are true to size! they have just the right amount of stretch, but maintain their fit all day.\n",
      "These \"jeans\" definitely look more like pants and are very snug, but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall, and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on, but are a tad tighter than i anticipated.\n",
      "Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.\n",
      "Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine, comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!\n",
      "This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. \r\n",
      "definitely recommend.\n",
      "The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit\n",
      "Really beautiful top. i agree with the others, a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones, but i'm going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up.\n",
      "Boxy, short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...\n",
      "......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however, i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim, 5'9\" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly, this one went back....\n",
      "This blouse does have a flowy, boxy shape to it but the details make up for that. when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering. i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted.\n",
      "I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7\" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!\n",
      "Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that.\n",
      "I didn't look at this dress twice online but when i tried it on in the store i was floored. it was beautiful, flattering, and so much fun.\n",
      "I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day, but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere, so i had to return it.\n",
      "This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5\", 127 pounds and a 30f chest, you never know how a top will fit. however, this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer, it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online, it would\n",
      "I got this top in the \"brown\" color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very well-made and has beautiful details from the pleated collar/neckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top: in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly\n",
      "The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......\n",

      "this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't\n",
      "I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.\n",
      "The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.\n",
      "I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.\n",
      "I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes\n",
      "Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy, doesn't need to be ironed really, substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i'm rarely a 2 at retailer, but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i'm usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this.\n",

      "slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.\n",
      "I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11\" so the shortness of the top isn't a factor. the material drapes nicely and doesn't make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are\n",
      "I purchased in the raspberry, love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool, and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.\n",
      "While i love this top ( beautiful color and pattern) i found it to be a bit short.  if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled.  i'm 5'8 ,  curvy, and have a long torso-- so that may be the problem. i will say that within 2 hours of wearing this, i had 5 strangers stop me and comment re: how pretty it is. i am keeping it :)\n",
      "I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it \"might\" be sort of cute. a comfy, flowy, warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room, including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store, and it still looked great! it is comfortable, loose, and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr\n",
      "I really lived the detail , fabric, and quality of this tank. however, the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing.\n",
      "I tried on this dress in store and was amazed by the quality and simple structure of the dress. bought it with no hesitation.\n",
      "I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "love most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return.\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful dress. i'm 5'11 and this dress works for tall girls:))\n",
      "No need to be on the fence about this top, it's lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!\n",
      "Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing, but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.\n",
      "I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that's lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn't suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it's calling your name.\n",
      "I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.\n",
      "This top is my favorite spring item. the color is a soft petal, but it doesn't wash me out (i'm a sandy paleface), and the details make it special. the cut is a little wide (i sized down), but it's also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt. it's really a find.\n",
      "Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.\n",
      "The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how\n",
      "Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very \"retailer\" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed.\n",
      "This is a very pretty, feminine top with nice detailing.\n",
      "I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.\n",
      "Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "would not recommend\n",
      "Expected them to fit somewhat loose but actually tight for a boyfriend fit. like a slightly relaxed skinny with a really low crotch. stretches everywhere when sitting and walking except the waistband. the distressing and fraying holes in good placement. wish there was some on the back of the leg but i have yet to find a pair that does that. good color and quality, but not quite worth full price. will probably look for them on sale later. i always prefer skinny jeans over boyfriend do it might bi\n",
      "The blouse is gorgeous. the detail to the blouse is outstanding and it is very feminine. from the pictures, front and back, there appears to be flow to it and room. however, my general size m was absolutely gigantic. it was like a tent. i was speechless when i looked in the mirror. i debated tapering it and then thought that's just too much effort. i'm going to return and see if i can order in 2 sizes smaller. i'm 5'1 and a 36c, if this helps.\n",
      "This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck\n",
      "I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.\n",
      "Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.\n",
      "I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it's a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.\n",
      "Like others, i think this is just lovely on so many levels. however...\r\n",

      "The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide, but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops, but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium, my normal size.\n",
      "\n",
      "This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.\n",
      "I love this top! it is sheer, so wear a cami, but it so pretty, i will wear it a lot! a winner for sure.\n",
      "I have the jeans version of these pants, and these run smaller and they're a little thinner than jeans. i like the style, and i looove the jeans, but i'll have to exchange these for one size bigger and see if they work.\n",
      "Beautiful and delicate!!\n",
      "This dress is beautiful and extremely flattering- i have an hourglass shape, and this dress highlighted that perfectly. the pictures online do not do it justice.\n",
      "I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine, one arm is a darker blue tie-dye, the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much, so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey, but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday, put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans, out to dinner we went!\n",
      "The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.\n",
      "This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out, black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "For myself it brings out the playful side of me. it is flows and just looks lovely. i wore it with a white denim skirt, and booties. i know white, and it looked great. the fabric is beautiful, and in the sun it is breathtaking\n",
      "Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!\n",
      "These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.\n",
      "I am giving this dress 3 stars bc it's pretty and i bought it, but i'm going to need to get it altered big time. i got the 00 and it's too big on top, but this is the type of dress that should be fitted on top. i am a small person, but this fit more like a 4 or 6. print is beautiful though. wayyy prettier than the pic. i suggest getting 2 sizes down. i could see it being extremely gorgeous if it fits correctly!\n",
      "I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am, this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets\n",
      "I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.\n",
      "I'm 5\"1, 115 and bought the small. i buy most retailer tops in xs but the small fit well - not too tight and is flattering. the colors are as seen and are a soft muted color. the material is thin which is fine for hot weather and i haven't washed so can't say how colors will hold and how well material will hold but have high expectations for retailer apparel. this will work well to wear with shorts or a navy maxi skirt. adds a nice touch of color for spring and summer.\n",
      "I usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size. i personally loved the fit. in the front, the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line. there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden. the fabric falls nicely there. the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist. i love both of the prints. the tops seem to be well made. time will tell.\n",
      "Very lovely dress!!! perfect in all ways. although i do find it to run big. i ordered the small, and i usually wear a 4 to 6 in a dress. there is a lot of fabric, but it lays nicely. it's mostly just the arm hole. it's rather large showing the strapless bra. so, deciding if i should size down, if there isn't a huge change in sizing, or keep and have altered.\n",
      "if anyone has tried in both the xs and sm i will watch for comments overall size differences. i have the black and white, and wish now i wo\n",
      "The photo does not do this top justice. the design of this peplum is very slimming and the colors are complimentary to any skin tone. i usually wear a m (10) but purchased the l based on other reviews. it fits perfectly. \r\n",
      "would highly recommend!\n",
      "Even though i had to return this top because it did not fit me properly, it's a very nicely made and attractive piece with a lot of versatility.\n",
      "I love the feel and drape of silk. this dress has lovely drape, and fantastic color. i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings, this will work well into the fall, and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy! the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape, otherwise it's a beautiful swing fit.\n",
      "Based on other reviews that this top ran large, i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size), and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats, so the bottom of this top really, really, really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10\"). the material is very thin, and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.\n",
      "I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge\n",
      "Love this top! bought it in the relish color - loved it so much bought the green too! usually wear a small but the medium was perfect.\n",
      "I love this top. fit is perfect for me. shows just the right amount of cleavage. wore it to dinner on my birthday and got a ton of compliments!\n",
      "Cute pattern, but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!\n",
      "I purchased the mustard colored item and it is very good for spring. nice fit, nice quality\n",
      "Have worn this top multiple times with jeans. neckline makes even those of us who are small busted look great up top!\n",
      "This top is all around great for summer... i've worn it to festivals, for casual workwear, etc. love the colors, they're vibrant. this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it.\n",
      "This is a very flattering and comfortable top that can easily transition into fall. i can't wait to wear it (i have the black and white one) under my new leather jacket! the store was out of my size, so i had to order the top, which came with a small snag. i trimmed the thread and wore it anyway! it is also long enough to wear with leggings.\n",
      "Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.\n",
      "This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th\n",
      "The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black, as i thought it was), but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown, the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft, nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.\n",
      "Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want.  like the laser cut detail front and back.  sleeveless is great for summer months here.  can wear to work or dress down with jeans.  fit is true to size.  i am 5'5\", slim and small busted so anything fits me.  i would think it you're busty it would be fine as it's a blousy fit.\r\n",
      "the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me.  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work.\n",
      "I ordered this in an 8p yellow. the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping it'd be, but i'm keeping it because it fits me perfectly. i am chesty for my size (32ddd), and somehow i don't look bigger than i am in this top. i also have broad shoulders and this doesn't feel tight when i move my arms. bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place! i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f\n",
      "I have been eyeing this dress for months and finally, a sale. the pattern is beautiful and is a great quality. the fit:\n",
      "it is a swing dress, so if you are a bigger girl, this may not be flattering; try a belt though. the high neck could be a bother for some-it does fit close to the neck, but not tight.\n",
      "also, size down...two sizes. i do usually a medium and i went with a petite small.\n",
      "finally, this dress can be worn in summer and winter. i do a belt and a blazer for office and a light sweater for\n",
      "This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!\n",
      "I love this dress and would have bought it on the spot without hesitation if i just had an event to wear it to! i am plus sized (18 pants, 16 dress, 5' 7\", 36-38 ddd) and i never size down but i was able to with this dress because it is so flowy. the dress hit just below my knee and the only fit difference i saw when i tried on the petite is that it was slightly shorter (still no thigh showing). this would be flattering on absolutely anyone! if you are worried about bulges this dress will give y\n",
      "This skirt is beautiful, i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it, sadly, though, i have to decide between too many nice things... what to do! i tried on the 0, and it fits me perfectly. above the knee, waist just right (26.5 in). colors are fun and great for fall, but could also summer-ize the skirt.fabric is thick, however, and well-made. i highly recommen, but leave a 0 for me!\n",
      "I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me, but i can see that if i were any larger chested, it might be an issue. (for reference, i'm a 32d, 5'4, 112lb.) it's very forgiving on the tummy area, without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality, really comfortable, and it's easy to wear with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc., making it a welcome versatile piece.\n",
      "This was really cute and fit true to size. the only thing i didn't love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage. i probably shouldn't have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model, but it doesn't lay flat correctly there like the right side. either way, it's still very flattering and cute.\n",
      "I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.\n",
      "I purchased the coral color. i'm usually between an xs and small in this brand, and i felt the top runs a tad small, so the small fit much better. simple and flattering top.\n",
      "I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.\n",
      "I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.\n",
      "This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!\n",
      "I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl\n",
      "The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!\n",
      "Definitely size down, the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.\n",
      "This shirt is so cute. very casual. looks and fits exactly like the model and a basic retailer fit around the waist.\n",
      "The fabric was more \"southwestern\" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.\n",
      "Very true to size. i'm a sm-med or 6-8. my sizing varies widely at retailer and this was a perfect medium fit.\r\n",
      "adorable with jeans or shorts. or dress up with suit or pencil skirt.\r\n",
      "i have the blue/green.\n",
      "Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.\n",
      "I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.\n",
      "If you're looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5'4\", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i'm not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous, but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.\n",
      "This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light, but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.\r\n",
      "i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2\" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo\n",
      "The pattern and fabric are very nice! i'm usually an 8/m for dresses. it was very narrow across the top (and i have a small chest), but hung very low in the armpit. i guess if you're small up top, this might fit better.\n",
      "This is a perfect casual too to pair with jns and shorts for spring!!\n",
      "I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.\n",
      "Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8\", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it's long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me.\n",
      "This top is beautiful and fits true to size, 4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white, lavendar, the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to\n",
      "I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7\" and the length was fine for me.\n",
      "I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool.\n",
      "my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.\n",
      "I was looking for a navy top to replace an overused navy silk cowlneck that i have been wearing for years. this is perfect. light, versatile and classic.\n",
      "I purchased this top on sale and it's almost perfect. the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit - not enough to make me want to return it, but i'm glad i didn't pay full price!\n",
      "\n",
      "Super cute with skinny jeans. true to size. i'm size 4, 138 pounds and 34c got a small\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.\n",
      "Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.\n",
      "I purchased the teal/blue version and the colors are slightly muted, but very pretty. i wish it were a tad bit longer, but if you're looking for a shirt that does not look like a tunic, this is ideal. it's cotton, so it feels like a t-shirt, but with a much more elevated design and cut. a cute and easy top!\n",
      "I was impressed with the textured knit of this piece, which looked nicer in person than online, and the open neckline with a contrasting stripe. i really liked that the whole bodice was lined with a sewn-in lining from neck to hem (minus the sleeves). i would have loved the dress overall but my usual size small was snug at the hips and it would have just made me too self-conscious for that reason. sadly, i have to return mine, but i would certainly recommend the style for someone with slim hips,\n",
      "This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!\n",
      "Love the style and cut of this top, but fabric is quite thin. tts if not a tad on the small side. i'm small busted so my usual medium was fine. undecided if i'm keeping this top or not.\n",
      "I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites, so i tried a large, and it was tight in the bust, but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.\n",
      "I didn't love it enough to buy it, but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.\n",
      "I did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking, but otherwise really liked this top. i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference\n",
      "Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7\", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!\n",
      "I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.\n",
      "I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.\n",
      "Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.\n",
      "I love how it fits very flattering! the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected. but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round!\n",
      "The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!\n",
      "This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.\n",
      "This top is adorable ,i finally broke down and bought it,so happy i did fits good,not too long sits at hip were it should (very flattering) i went with the reviews and sized up,i am a petite sx normally in retailer,but went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i did!it is a bit snug(not tight) in the chest,but has stretch to it , i am 5'1 108 33d (if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium,) i got the purple motif (print) no see thru issues,the material is a comfortab\n",
      "The top is adorable, but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.\n",

      "Normally i would never try on anything with horizontal stripes.... but for some reason, i saw it in my store and gave the dress a try. fit is perfect, and dress is lined. (side note: my store had the navy dress and the stripes are horizontal and not diagonal as pictured on the model- dress looks like the ivory dress.) can be dressed up or down, so ill be a great summer go to dress. i am a curvy girl and because of the different widths of the stripes the dress works and is very flattering. i'm ve\n",

      "I absolutely love this top! i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well. the top is very flattering and works with any occasion. the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra. i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments!\n",
      "I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!\n",
      "When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.\n",

      "I adore this blouse, but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.\n",
      "I ordered a size 4, my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops, i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4\" 120 lbs,, 32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath, which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work.\n",
      "My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. \r\n",

      " i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.\n",
      "I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece\n",
      "The print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice weight. i actually bought this because i'm early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period - because of its swing shape, this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in 6 months when i've got a huge belly.\r\n",

      "Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.\n",
      "I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. \r\n",
      "other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.\n",
      "This top is perfect for summer. it delivers style without the bulk. the peplum hit perfect for my 5'4 frame. unfortunately it was too low cut in the front. i had to return it.\n",
      "This shirt is very flattering, which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3\" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.\n",
      "Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.\n",
      "I tried this on in-store. it is super cute! i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasn't sure it was completely worth the price. if you are in-between sizes, take the larger size.\n",
      "I bought my usual size medium and it's huge on me. if i sized down, my chubneck wouldn't be comfortable. the buttons are frustrating. the color, the pattten, the style are 100% gorgeous! i think i will belt mine\n",
      "Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top\n",
      "I love this top! i ordered the print, and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans, and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews, and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.\n",
      "Fun pattern which goes with just about anything. cool for summer.  very comfortable.  fitted style but true to size.\n",

      "i typically wear a m in a knit top, but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my\n",
      "I was nervous about buying this without trying it on, but i followed the size chart and wasn't disappointed! it's flattering thanks to the fitted upper-half and the forgiving peplum bottom-half. overall, it's thin, light, and airy.\n",
      "I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed\n",
      "I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect\n",
      "Just note the pink is different than in the photos. much hotter/more saturated. apart from that surprise, overall i'd recommend. nice design.\n",

      "I ordered this lovely blouse the moment i saw it, and i am very pleased that it is the quality and fit i'd hoped for. i bought the medium in pink. i am 130#, 34f, size 8 or medium on most tops. the medium fits me perfectly; i love the gathering at top back so that there is no pulling at all across the back or bust. i am mystified that all blouses aren't designed with a nice level of gathering to accommodate a bust and to give a flattering flow.. i am busty so awkward tightness can be a problem o\n",
      "Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.\n",
      "I love the teal/aqua version. the colors are very pretty and look great with jeans. i got a medium. it runs a tiny bit small but a lot of fitted tops at retailer run smaller on me. i like the style a lot and the peplum is great.\n",
      "This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.\n",
      "I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.\n",
      "Love this top - on sale, i bought two of this color, a grey and the green, i never buy more than one of anything unless i absolutely love it ! complimentary to the body, and the colors are beautiful. i'm 5'2\" there were no pxs so i opted for xs, perfect... thanks retailer ??\n",
      "Purchased on sale, would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.\n",
      "I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing, since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly, so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design, but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.\n",
      "Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.\n",
      "It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.\n",
      "I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall, it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!\n",
      "This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.\n",
      "Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!\n",
      "I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4\" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside\n",
      "This shirt is purportedly made of silk, but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.\n",
      "This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "When i saw the dress online i thought the print was beautiful and fun, and was not disappointed when the dress came in. the material is very soft, breathable, and easy to wear. i dress it down with a jean jacket or a jean vest but it can easily be worn by itself. it's definitely a delight go to dress for the weekends.\n",
      "This vest is adorable! i love the color, it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great, some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly, i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall, but it works perfectly with my build.\n",
      "This is a lovely dress - however, there is a weird flap of fabric under the bow that doesn't sit right. it feels a little like a bib. if i could get it to sit right, i would keep it. every angle of the dress is lovely except for head on - which is a small problem.\n",
      "The poncho style sweater has is a light airy cotton fabric ideal for a extra layer but certainly not warm, the hook and eye attaching the arm to the sweater is not ideal, i had to have a seamstress sew it and remove the hook, its just not practical that way, happy with purchase,\n",
      "The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.\n",
      "Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!\n",
      "Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4\", 138#.  even at my age it looks great.\n",
      "The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.\n",
      "According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.\n",
      "This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately\n",
      "If you are looking for a nice vest, this vest is nice enough, comfortable, and soft. the cut is also flattering, but i just didn't think it was as special as i wanted. it looks like many other options out there, so i decided to pass.\r\n",

      "This dress makes my heart skip a beat. it's beautiful, soft and colorful. it's a lovely midi length which can be tricky for 5'5\" lil ole me but it's perfect. it has slits up the side for an easy breezy look. the fabric is so silky & pretty form fitting if you buy the right size. i'm a solid 4. have bought heaps of dresses from retailer and i can't stop, won't stop.\n",
      "I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple, but i don't own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down, which simply does not work for me, given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it's not flattering. this top is flannel, no buttons, and off the shoulder, which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put\n",
      "Comfortable, great fit and beautiful colors. the interesting thing is that in this picture, it shows the dress just below the knee. i am 5'5\" so totally average height, but the dress falls just above my ankles., which i personally think is way more attractive. not sure if there are two versions of this dress, but be careful if you buy online. i got mine in the glendale store.\n",
      "What a great, soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.\n",

      "I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.\n",
      "The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.\n",
      "I love how this sweater fits. i was reluctant to get it because i thought it would be boxy, but it's a perfect length, especially for a higher waisted pants or jeans. the fabric is super soft. i only gave it four stars because i thought it was going to be grey, but it's more like a marled black/white, 80s-style color.\n",

      "Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.\n",

      "The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3\" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom.\n",

      "I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.\n",
      "I had a really, really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it, i wanted to love it! in theory, it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however, as you can see for yourself in the photo, this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle\n",
      "I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft\n",
      "This dress is everything i hoped it would be: flattering, cute, cozy\n",
      "Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.\n",
      "When i first saw this dress i was in love. i adore mexican print clothing and i couldn't wait to try this on. unfortunately, it is not as described, and it looks better in the photo than in person. the dress looks like it is embroidered, and it is not- the design is printed. second, it is described as a stretch fabric-lycra spandex-there was no stretch at all except for the back waist which was elastic and the fabric was very stiff. it pulls on over your head and there is no zipper. i couldn't e\n",
      "I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.\n",
      "The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning.\n",
      "This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.\n",
      "I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.\n",
      "I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6\" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.\n",
      "This dress is by no means a statement piece, but if you're in need of a good basic to get you through winter, this is a great option. i'm normally a m or l (busty and hippy hourglass shape) and found it to fit tts in a l. (if you fall in-between two sizes but don't have larger hips or a larger bust like i do, you could probably size down to the smaller of your two sizes.) it goes great with black tights, tall black boots and a scarf. i didn't realize at the time i ordered it that the material is\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.\n",
      "I'm in love with this top! looks just like it does in the photos, except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant. it's definitely boxy, so you may not like it if boxy isn't your thing, but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape. i usually wear a small in tops and the xs/s fits great. it's also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus (although i haven't washed it yet). unique, chic, and effortless...order before it's gone!\n",
      "So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small, didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine, has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(\n",
      "I love this vest, good denim quality\n",
      "I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.\n",
      "This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.\n",
      "Cute style, cute color, cute cut.  and i got it on sale!\n",
      "I wanted so badly to keep this dress :( the print is beautiful in person, and the fabric feels pretty nice for a polyester. the waist silhouette is incredibly flattering--the way the waistline and pleats fall made me a look a lot slimmer. it'd be a great dress for dancing, since it flares wonderfully when you twirl. but the puffed sleeves looked a lot more poofy on me than they did on the model, and i wound up looking exactly like a picture of my mother from 1982. which isn't necessarily a bad t\n",
      "Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8\", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them\n",
      "Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms, and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8\", 128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially, women quite far along in their pregnancy.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.\n",
      "My friend and i both bought this in the \"white\" color in our usual sizes. the fabric is soft, the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute. hides a tummy beautifully. the store had the white and the green. the green color looks very different in person than it does online. in person, it is darker and more of a soft emerald green--not the pale green-gray pictured online.\n",
      "I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5\", medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal\n",
      "I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i\n",
      "I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown, which it was, but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little\n",
      "Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.\n",
      "I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3\" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body.\n",
      "First, this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look. \r\n",
      "however, there are several items to note. primarily, this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.\n",
      "I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.\n",
      "I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.\n",
      "I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.\n",
      "So this is actually a holding horses dress, its mislabeled on the website. tts, a stunning vintage inspired piece, very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut, this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small, fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!\n",
      "Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice, but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th\n",
      "Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10\" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.\n",
      "This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green, not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband, which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy, elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks, i decided to remove the tie string, which hangs low; it\n",
      "I didn't think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website. but after reading the reviews i decided to order it. and it did not disappoint. i ordered the green, which is more vibrant in-person than on the website. and i wore it the next day, which is always a good sign. i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too. it is flattering, stylish and comfortable - an excellent combination! i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple. it goes with everything.\n",
      "Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright, more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable, cute and easy to wear, a perfect dress for the fall/winter with\n",
      "Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color. great tank. it is not thin like some other retailer tops. it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we don't want anyone to see or worry about. \r\n",
      "the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.\r\n",
      "it is extremely comfortable a\n",
      "I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.\n",
      "This dress' style and color is very flattering. i think i will wear it in the spring and fall as well as the winter.the m fits me and i'm 5'8' and 140 pounds.\n",
      "I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.\n",
      "I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.\n",
      "Love these, always get compliments. i'm 5'7\" bought size small. washed in warm & line dried. they are a bit shorter. lengthen the straps, drops the waist, but at least gets them to my feet\n",
      "This top is flowy, fluid and comfortable. the material is like a stretchy crepe. it's thin, but not sheer. well, i bought the bright red (maybe white is sheer?). oh, speaking of bright red, well it is! i mean, it is the most vibrant red. the photo on-line (at least on my screen) doesn't really do the red justice at all.\r\n",

      "I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....\n",
      "I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress!\r\n",
      "it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it\n",
      "It's just as cute in person as it was in the picture. the material is very, very soft and 'sweater like'. i ordered my usual size and it fit fine, but i usually wear my dresses a bit looser. i liked it well enough to return it for a larger size.\n",
      "Warm, cozy, can dress down/up, and is perfect for traveling. a great staple. as other people noted, the dress (if you buy your regular size) is a little more fitted than it looks on the model. size up if you prefer it to hang looser.\n",
      "Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.\n",
      "A great sweater to throw over just about anything. i love it, but the only reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is because you must be very carful with it, as it can snag on anything. the fabric is similar to intertwined ribbons. the first time i put it on i got a snag right away, but it was easily pulled trough to the inside. now i am just super cautious. i do love it though. very comfortable and super casual. not heavy at all, but just enough to be happy to have to throw on when the cool spring/s\n",
      "I love wearing a dress at thanksgiving but don't want to be too dressy. this was perfect;: casual with a bit of sass and comfortable. it's also arm enough and super cute with booties. i'm 5'4\" and small boned. the xs fit perfect.\n",
      "This tank top is comfortable and very cute. it hides my tummy, as well, which is a bonus! ordered in another color i love it so much\n",
      "I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.\n",
      "I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me.\n",
      "the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in, so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6, but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow, but not overly so, so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything, for many seasons. love the quality.\n",
      "I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i haven't tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.\n",
      "I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows, but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing, and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them, i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel\n",
      "I love this jacket. it is stylish, yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear. the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun, and, the fitted cut flatters your shape.\n",
      "I bought this top as it is perfect for work under a blazer! the patten is pretty and eye catching, i love that it's 100% silk and has the tie in front so it's not too low for work. so chic and sophisticated!\n",
      "This material of this shirt is soft and appealing. great for fall. the side slits are longer than they appear in the picture so wearing it both tucked and untucked requires a layering shirt underneath.\n",

      "the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece.\n",

      "Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!\n",
      "I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked, it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels, or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide\n",

      "I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget, and i couldn't resist taking it home. the photo doesn't do the textured sheen of the silk justice--the metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant, but still subtle. my husband (who usually hates anything with a bow) loves this, though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model. go one size down--i usually wear a 14 in blouses but took a 12 in this.\n",
      "Adorable soft top for the fall! i wanted to love it because of the colors and the fact that it is so retro! it was just way too big for me. i'm always a medium but in this i probably should have sized down. i still gave it 5 stars because it is so cute--just didn't fit me! sadly i will be returning this!\n",
      "Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it \"gaps\" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.\r\n",

      "I tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering. the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isn't constricting. i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big. the fur collar is a special touch. the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there. i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there. however, the fit is so flattering i m\n",

      "This sweater was far better than expected. very soft, and flattering. it's light to wear, but keeps me cozy in my freezing office. looks super cute with jeans and boots.\n",
      "I tried this top in both colors. for the black, the lining looks much more peach in person. the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top. you can see it in the picture, but is much more pronounced in person. it appears to be where 2 pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy.\n",

      "This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue), but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).\n",
      "This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.\n",
      "This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!\n",
      "I love this blouse, but after i got it i decided i really didn't need another white long blouse. it was more of a want than a need. very stylish and comfy with nice neckline. i love retailer anything. i'm obsessed with this store and every single thing in it. even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors.\n",
      "I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.\n",
      "I purchased a small in this dress. 5'6\" 34d. i could have gone with a medium if i wanted to wear a bra. this dress is not meant to be worn with one. it fit much better without. i liked the regular length as the dress is supposed to be a midi. this dress screams \"summer\" to me.\n",
      "I really like this shirt but it's a bit maternity. i don't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here. i'm 5' 7\" about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret. since i'm done having kids, it has to go back. \r\n",
      "it's also somewhat see through and had i kept it, i would have worn a tank top underneath.\r\n",
      "as long as these things don't bother you, it really is cute!\n",
      "Love this big top...! will be great for hot summer days.\n",
      "I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped. \r\n",
      "it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust. \r\n",
      "the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.\n",
      "The fabric is so soft and completely lined; the straps are adjustable.\r\n",
      "this is the best summer dress ever!!! so comfortable and easy to just throw on. goes with a multitude of colors for your sandals and bags. i love this dress!\r\n",
      "i'm 5' 7\", 137 lbs., and ordered a size medium, with plenty of room around the bust; no worry about arm holes being too big because you adjust the straps to suit your body. i love the below the knee length. i like comfy but you could easily size down.\r\n",
      "nice embroidery\n",
      "Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!\n",
      "I've been looking for a great long, loose, versatile vest for some time, and this is just about perfect. it's slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate), but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger, and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!\n",
      "The colors are amazing. so vibrant and plentiful. the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad. i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress. i got a medium.. i'm 170 with a small chest. medium is my norm for maeve. the buttons in the back are difficult, you need help getting on, but getting off you can do solo. this dress makes your shoulders look really good!! it sits in a very flattering way.\n",
      "This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.\n",
      "So comfy, great quality, not see thru at all, has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway, dont need a bra.\n",
      "Wow. i just love this dress. it hangs beautifully and is such a great length. shoulder straps adjustable, simple button closures in back. i wore it dressed up a bit with a sweater and then again more causal without. i got it on sale so it fit even better!! :)\n",
      "The material of the dress is gorgeous, but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition, i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow, exposing your \"chicken wings\" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model, so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot!\n",
      "I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.\n",
      "This vest is so cute and flattering. these pictures don't do it justice. you must see it in person and try it on. it only has a small percentage of wool in it, so it could easily be worn in the spring/summer with a tank.\n",
      "I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8\" 140#.  overall i sent it back.\n",
      "This vest is awesome - the photo does not do it justice. you can dress it up or dress it down. great materials used. does run big, so select one size down!\n",
      "Love the look of the pant! would have given more stars if it had arrived wearable. the pockets all had a corner stuck folded up, requiring washing or ironing before i can even wear them. worried that they will constantly have that issue.\n",
      "This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.\n",
      "The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is, it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better, but i returned it.\n",
      "Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.\n",
      "This is a pretty dress, but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.\n",
      "This is a great light, free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area, but if you are small busted, you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!\n",
      "Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it's summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.\n",
      "This blouse is a beauty! i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back. i love the long length and the side slits. the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely. the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at. it makes me feel beautiful just having it on. be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank, but i don't mind as it is both pretty and comfortable. i sized up, which fits how i like. i never tried it on in my normal size\n",
      "I have several pilcro jeans in a size 26 that fit great but these ended up being just a little bit too tight in the thigh area to make the style of the jeans looks right. going to return for a larger size. nice material though!\n",
      "I had been eyeing this top online, decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic!\n",
      "i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference, i am 5'7\" and 139 pds, small busted, and i bought a size 6, fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!\n",
      "Not sure why some people did not like the fit. i am a \"d\" and yes the seam sits along bust, but not in a weird way. love this shirt, its adorable.\n",
      "I love this top it is cute with shorts, capris and jeans. it's really comfortable but looks put together and stylish.  great for running errands to drinks with the girls. a good transition piece into fall with a light cardigan.\n",
      "My favorite white blouse ever.\n",
      "i was hesitant, but really love it. it makes me think of summer, flowers, paris.... it's so soft and comfortable. yes, the cut is different and took a moment to get used to... but i like that. and it looks better on. imo. i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days. i've been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time. tres chic!\n",
      "This is a must have! way cuter in person. love the look and feel. it runs large so size down. it's more cream than white\n",
      "Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique, it's very \"floaty\" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. \r\n",
      "the \"empire\" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6\" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.\n",
      "Hey hei hei! where did your side buttons go on this design? on all of the other hei hei's i own there are two or three very cute side buttons at the hips in belt area with a matching also cute cloth strip attached so that when the pant becomes too lose at the waist you can tighten it up a notch. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i bought the sky & yellow in these pants in a size 10. i am 158 lbs and 5'6.\" when i first put these on they fit just like i want them too (a bit of a boyfriend pant feel, not too slouchy), but witho\n",
      "I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size\n",
      "Love these pants. the perfect cuffed crop pant for the summer. lightweight, cool, and comfortable. fun pocket details. i typically wear a 26 and bought a 2 in these. within a short time, they were slipping a bit low on the waist. that's my only frustration. they are a loose fitting pant but they shouldn't slip off the waist. perhaps a 0 would fit better. these weren't in my local store (an hour away), so i ordered online. perhaps i'll try ordering another color in both the 0 and 2. i would sugge\n",
      "Love this top! tried it on in the store & loved it more. it's a great transitional piece with rich colors. the top is sheer so will need to layer with a camisole. haven't worn yet so can't speak to how well it will wash.\n",
      "I really liked the fabric and look of this top, but i was swimming in fabric.  there was so much that the top felt heavy.  i returned it.\n",
      "Probably not for everyone but boy do i love it and i've gotten loads of compliments on it! looks best with skinny jeans, would be good with leggings also.\n",
      "\n",
      "i am 5'7\", 155# and bought a size 10, fits perfectly!\n",
      "I saw this dress in store. at first i was not impressed because it was shapeless on but i added a belt and it was so much better. i styled it with my leather wrap around ada belt. looks great with a jean jacket or a leather jacket to make it look more chic.\n",
      "I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.\n",
      "I didn't notice this dress online but it jumped out at me at the store.  i sized down to a small as the bust and arm area seemed very loose in  medium.  (36b). it's very comfy and beautiful.  i tried it with  a belt,  but quite honestly  it doesn't need one and it looks so much nicer without one.  not sure about what bra to wear ...likely strapless , or as one person said. .none.\n",
      "The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel\n",
      "This may be one of the cutest items that i have every owned! runs big, i am a 4 and the 0 fits perfectly.\n",
      "These photos do not do the vest any justice. i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer. tried it on and it was super cute, but i did the whole \"walk away, maybe you'll forget about it\" thing. that did not happen. i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day, and thank goodness, there was still one left in my size. it actually drapes in a flattering way, and it looks polished. it's so versatile. i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos, but i'm telling y\n",
      "So i thought this sweater would be snowy white, but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive, i do like it, just because it is not snowy white like i thought, it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no\n",
      "This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric , but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.\n",
      "Love the cotton knit, for the comfort, but from a distance this blouse looks dressier. the embroidery adds a nice flare. personally, i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom, as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants. i found that it ran a little bit, but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway.\n",
      "I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring, or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side, it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad, but i will definitely have to\n",
      "Order a whole size down and this may work. i'm normally a 6-8 or a medium but this was huge. ordered the small because i loved the color/design. hopeful!\n",
      "I adore a good vest, so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often, but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it, took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl, and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line, and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin, or even w\n",
      "Love these! no bulging, substantive fabric, very flattering cut. i'm 5'7\", 170 lbs, wearing a size 12. these were perfectly cut for me, no pulling, bulging, or weird gathering in awkward areas (we all know what that means).. these will be a true staple for me with a variety of high-heeled sandals, kitten heels, and gladiators - i can't wait to wear them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "my only concern is the fabric and it's ability to repel stains - sometimes the trade off for stretch is easy care. we'll see. i'm willing to\n",
      "I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it. \r\n",
      "i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect.\n",
      "I love how boho, colorful and comfy this dress is. sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesn't cover the straps. they were out of the petite small so i went with the small. i am 5' 125 lbs, and it fits perfectly, just more of a midi length. no problemo!\n",
      "Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.\n",
      "I saw this dress and had to have it. it is very cute and comfortable. i have fuller hips, so i'm not sure about the stripe across the widest section of my body. the arm holes are a little gaping as well as other reviewers have mentioned. i bought the medium which fits well everywhere, but the arm holes. i think the small would fit me everywhere, but the hips. so, i'm on the fence of whether to keep it. i do like the dress and it is of good quality; it just may not be the right fit for me. i'm a\n",
      "Beautiful dress, i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.\n",
      "I saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses, so off i went to my local retailer. this blouse turned out to be delightful! my thoughts: i would say it fits true to size, as a 0 fits me perfectly in the shoulders. it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit, so it's not possible to wear this as a dress (it is very sheer too). i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust, so my incredibly flat chest works in this. if you have even\n",
      "Nice dress, but the leather seats of my car were ruined when the sharp metal beads on the back made deep scratches~ not fun at all. now i must carefully take them out, bad design feature.\n",
      "I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected. the arm holes are a little large, meaning low. but other than that i love it.\n",
      "I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but, this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored, but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "now, the fabric is stiff. and, it's sheer. but, the pockets land where your breasts are. so, i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however, if this is for work, i'd put a cami under\n",
      "I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on, not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric, but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants, and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store, i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are\n",

      "The details on these capris are adorable - the stitching and side ribbon detail, the fit, weight of the fabric, everything is fantastic. i got the taupe and moss green because i couldn't decide. i wish they came in more colors. fit, for me, was true to size, i usually wear a 2 to a 4 (size 26 to 27 in denim) and got the 2 because i wanted them to be more fitted. they stretched a bit after wear, but not so much that they were too baggy. i will live in these, this summer. if you want a more fitted\n",
      "\n",
      "I love love love this top! so flattering and comfortable- looks great with jeans, leggings, or i totally plan to use it as a beach cover-up as well. they only had medium left (i usually get xs/s) but it was still as flattering and i usually like my clothes on the roomy side!\n",
      "Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.\r\n",
      "great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.\n",
      "I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a\n",
      "If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.\n",
      "I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!\n",
      "I really wanted to like this shirt, but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.\n",
      "Very unique, beautiful piece.  drapes well, accentuates curves in a classy way.  this is an eye catcher.  definitely.\n",
      "This vest is great. i'm wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here. i can see this going with so many outfits. mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area- this will cover it all. worth full price imo. tts. i'm a 10 and this in m is perfect.\n",

      "This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems, it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings, especially since it's priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered\n",

      "I was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on, the more i liked it. i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big. i'm 5'4 and 108 and the xs is pretty voluminous on me. it's just so darn different and feminine though that i'm going to live with the fact that there is so much material. i think it is still cute. the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too.\n",

      "This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy, feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully, i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful\n",
      "I ordered this in size xl and it is now a favorite of mine. the sleeves are tighter on me than pictured. i've had great luck with this brand and was a little surprised that the sleeves were cut tighter than typical. the material has a little give so i was able to stretch that out a bit. everything else was true-to-size. the sleeves are a little long but i don't need to cuff them.\n",

      "This is a cute casual dress. i've received many compliments and wear it a lot. i deducted one star because the dress is pilling in some places (mostly expected friction areas, but others as well). also the back of the dress started to rip at the stress points for the button up area. i mended it, but it should have been reinforced to begin with for a dress at the original price point.\n",

      "I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it, it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled, but i'm used to ironing things, so that didn't bother me. unfortunately, i had to return it though because of the color. i'm filipino, and this yellow just isn't flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with, but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring\n",
      "This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!\n",
      "I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it.\n",
      "This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little \"shapeless\". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!\n",
      "The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but, it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.\n",
      "This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.\n",
      "Awful color, horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed\n",
      "I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt. i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look \"puffy!\"\n",
      "I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2\", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!\n",
      "This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!\n",
      "Very pretty top. however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering. fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides - i looked pregnant. had to return.\n",
      "I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3\" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have\n",
      "I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large, but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love trying things outside my usual style, thought this might look like a sack but fell in love! looks effortless, easy to accessorize, dress up or down & comfortable. keeper! want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a size 4, my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso, but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.\n",
      "Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer. the dress detail is noted as a \"swing silhouette\" & should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor. the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink. a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect!\n",

      "This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5\" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer, i have this in a small and it fits perfectly, fits snug when zipped, my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!\n",
      "This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.\n",
      "Completely oversized top, size medium was swimming on me.....boxy, baggy, shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo, returned.\n",
      "This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.\n",
      "I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear \"cool\" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4\" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai\n",
      "This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.\n",
      "I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn't for me.\n",
      "I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty, it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute, lacy bandeau bra, the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad, since it is a cute top, and well made.\n",
      "I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn't quite the same.\n",
      "I purchased this jacket in a pxs, as i am 5'2\" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight, which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips. \r\n",

      "Gorgeous sweater, very unique, given as a gift so not sure how well it will wear\n",
      "I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review, it runs large in the armholes and across the bust, which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit, so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however, i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said, the detailing i\n",

      "I ordered the blue version in size xl. it looked just like the photos online. it fit true to size. the problem for me was the weight of the sweater. it was too bulky & uncomfortable to wear. the color of blue was nice. the knit wasn't very soft but wasn't scratchy either. i found a better choice from retailer so i returned this.\n",
      "I ordered a size xl in ivory. it's prettier in person. there are great details. it shrunk a bit after washing and air-drying. i cut off the layer of chiffon around the neckline to make it more comfortable. a cute summer tank.\n",
      "These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my \"go to\" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few \"tight\" hours! trust me...they will\n",
      "Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.\n",
      "Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too \"mom\" like.\n",
      "Love these pants! the print is very different, a little quirky, but black and light golden brown mixed together so very versatile. i have very thin legs and these are actually tight on me so maybe too slim for some.good length. they actually hit right at the ankle.\n",
      "This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??\n",
      "I really liked this cardigan when i saw it online. when i received it, i liked the quality of the yarn and the tie on the back, but the color seemed dull and i didn't like the huge safety pin on the lapel. i tried to remove it, but it was sewn on and was worried that if i snipped it off the thread, it might unravel the yarn. had to return it.\n",
      "I tried on this top in the store in a large and the arm holes were too big. i am busty and usually wear a size 10, so i usually need a m to l. i ordered a m which was shipped to my home, and it fit perfectly. really cute with skinny jeans!\n",
      "I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.\n",
      "I'm 5'1\", <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual. \r\n",

      "the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that, love it enough to keep.\n",
      "I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website, and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely, flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5\" 4\" and it skims the floor on me with a 2\" heel. can't wait to wear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately, this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well, it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the\n",
      "I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...\n",
      "Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.\n",
      "Love this shirt. i am 5'2\" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.\n",
      "This dress is very beautiful. the dark color makes it very elegant. i tried on different top (white, silver, light blue, etc). they all look very nice with the dress. you can wear it casually or formally...depending on what kind of top you wear.\n",
      "I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing, lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage, and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it, but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.\n",
      "Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down, which is hard to find too. perfect length, beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look\n",
      "This sweater is very cute. i got a medium, i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.\n",
      "Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person. glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case. drapes nicely (exactly like in the picture) and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardigan/shrug. loose fit means i can wear it to work, too. am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well. also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and i'm 5ft4 so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon\n",
      "I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear.\n",
      "Great, rather heavyweight, long cardi. i purchased the blue, which is a lovely shade of gray/blue, not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater, but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5\", 136 lbs, 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model.\n",
      "Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.\n",
      "Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!\n",
      "Gorgeous top but runs large, especially in the arm holes.\n",
      "I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.\n",
      "I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft, 105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed, i really wanted this top to work.\n",
      "These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r, they are perfect. gorgeous pattern, and i too, am not a \"pattern\"-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid, flowy maeve tops i have for work.\n",
      "Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.\n",
      "This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive, it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value, is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and, in addition to looking great does keep you warm.\n",
      "I am not really a \"print person\" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.\n",
      "i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well\n",
      "I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.\n",
      "This cardigan was a keeper for me. i love the pin that pulls the two sides together or worn open is just a nice decoration. four starts only because i felt like the arms ran a little short.\n",
      "I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6\" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests,wraps,shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.\n",
      "I got this planning to wear to a wedding, but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said, it is long, but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!\n",
      "You have to try it on to see, it fits really well and looks stylish. i love it.\r\n",
      "my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy, not sure if it will hold up well in the long run.\n",
      "The length hit at the wrong place for me. lovely knit though so i am very disappointed. it will be going back to the store. interesting muted color that strikes just the right balance. very warm - perfect for fall and winter.\n",
      "These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.\n",
      "Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu\n",

      "Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. doesn't wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.\n",
      "This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found \"the one'! i should note i am 5'9\" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.\n",
      "I liked the look of this dress online, so i called my local store and had them hold it in a small and medium because of the reviews. i am a 34dd, and had no issues with the bust on the small dress. it's a pretty, feminine dress and i'm glad they had the 20% off sale when i decided to buy it. the reason i'm writing a review is because the dress here is not the same as the dress in the store. the dress in the store is pictured in the \"get the look\" photo. the dress in the store has cap sleeves, wh\n",

      "I love, love love this top. i've bought several over the years and they wash great and are very flattering and comfortable. i always pick up the newest color.\n",
      "This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall, a deep vivid blue color, and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway, but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price, it just wasn't right for me.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.\n",
      "I tried on a regular size at the store, and definitely need petite (5'1.5', 115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale, and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot, where hte muscles meet. there is alining, so not see-through. length was too long, why i need petie, also loose-fitting, i would like it more a little more fitted, jsut a bit.\n",
      "I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory, not pure white, which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w\n",

      "Cute skort but seems to run big. it's also sort of long for shorts (the model must have much longer legs than me). i may try a size smaller since i love the print but i'm not optimistic.\n",
      "Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress. i'm always leery about buying lace and white, but i love this off-white color and style. i was able to stretch the sleeves a tad to make them more fluttery, but they aren't as fluttery as the photo looks. definitely more of a cap sleeve. got so many compliments!\n",
      "This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!\r\n",

      "I love this dress. the fit is great for tall girls i'm 5 9' and the length is perfect. can be dressed down with cute sneakers or up with heels. every time i wear this dress i get a ton of compliments and it is so comfortable.\n",
      "I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy, however, they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam, but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4\" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed.\n",
      "I like the jeans a lot. they're definitely skinny fit and more like leggings -- very stretchy. i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that \"give,\" so the claim that they're flattering on everyone is probably valid. i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing, as grey jeans often seem to have -- they are all one hue from top to bottom, with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric. the only flaw (at least i don't think it's intentional) is that the front pockets l\n",
      "The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty, though\n",
      "This is a great everyday dress. i bought it in black and it looks cute with wedges. it's a little boxy but that also makes it super comfy so i don't mind that too much. definitely order one-size down if you're between sizes. you may want to consider petite, if it's available, becuase i found it to be a bit long for my taste. (i'm 5'5\" and it hits at the knee). i've already worn it a few times and have had received several compliments.\n",

      "Purchased this dress in black and love it. there is so much detail in the crochet, and can be dressed up or down. i am contemplating buying the same dress in white!\n",
      "These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5\" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.\n",
      "I love this dress for it's unique design with the crochet features. it is super comfortable, great for being layered without see through. i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me. i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much. i'd recommend sizing down for this dress. i'm 5'6'', 135lbs, and still needed an xs which seems a bit off. i guess i'm used to retailer running a bit big, but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying\n",
      "These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall, but run large. depending on cut/style, i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these, and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero, but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!\n",
      "Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4\", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down.\n",
      "I am 5'4\" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter\n",
      "I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color, soft, flowy, fun, practical.\n",
      "This is stunning. even more stunning in person. the crochet is divine. every inch of it is beautifully detailed. it's got a bit of weight to it and the crochet is very high quality. i am normally a l or xl, and i have curves. this is why this unfortunately did not work for me. it fits more like a shift with a little more aline room. on the right shape, it will be perfect. if you're curvy, size up. if you're lean or narrow, you might want to size down. the length is heavenly for tall gals, but wi\n",
      "This is a beautiful, high-quality little black dress. it actually has a little weight to it, but nothing bothersome. i usually take a medium across the board, but i had to size up to a large. this is dress has more of a straight line versus a-line and i have wider hips, so the large fit really good. it's beautiful and versatile. i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments : ) great purchase, i would highly recommend.\n",
      "Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.\n",
      "I am so glad i found this tee. as usual i love bordeaux rayon-spandex shirts. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it's heavy enough to drape nicely contouring your natural curves. it does not cling to the body, is just loose enough to let you breathe during the hot summer days. i was afraid it would look like a swing tee and make me look like i am pregnant but it doesn't. it runs true to size. the only complaint i have is that the back runs too long.\n",
      "For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i' 5' 4\" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said \"frumpy\" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out.\n",
      "A scandalous mini skirt that isn't a skirt! beautiful pattern. does run a little big.\n",
      "The look is frest, crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!\n",
      "The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.\n",
      "Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!\n",
      "I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33\" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!\n",
      "Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please,  cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!\n",
      "Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.\n",
      "Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.\n",
      "When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress \"paeonia dress\", and i paired it with the \"rosebud layered necklace\". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6\", 127 and even thoug\n",
      "I thought this dress would make me look washed out, but absolutely doesn't--beautiful pop of color, and unique design. i've received many complements, this one is a keeper.\n",
      "This is a flattering skirt for work or play. a few things to be aware of: \r\n",
      "- it is a lightweight knit without a lining (would travel great and never need ironing)\r\n",
      "- the waist is quite high \r\n",
      "- the waist is quite slim (people with tummy self-consciousness might feel funny in it)\r\n",
      "- the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips (such as myself)\r\n",
      "- true to size for me\r\n",

      "This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.\n",
      "I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a\n",
      "I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(\n",
      "I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...\n",
      "This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.\n",
      "I love the unique style of this dress. the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details. as for fit ... i'm a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee.\n",
      "I ordered the pink and it is the slightest hint of pink mixed with ivory. it fits true to size. the detailing of the crochet is outstanding. it reminds me of seashells that my daughter & i collected last year when we visited san diego. i wish the teal green one would be in stock in xl. i would grab it up. it's not the softest knit, but it's very comfortable to wear all day. very pretty version of a cardigan.\n",
      "Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for\n",
      "I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how \"loose\" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10\" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11\" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide, but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color, which is more green and has very faint stripes. very\n",
      "I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.\n",
      "Great fit, a little stiff. i typically wear a 4, and was able to take a 2 in this skirt, though a 4 would probably have been fine! it's just a fun skirt, with a little shimmer to dress up an outfit.\n",
      "This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion. it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo. i'm 5'6\". i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable. i would suggest 1 size smaller than usual would fit well. i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses. it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan. it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus 1 turquoise stripe. it dresse\n",
      "This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.\n",
      "Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however, that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically, for the price, i was underwhelmed and will return it.\n",
      "I bought the gray and it is so much prettier than it appears online. i agree with a previous post that it feels lighter but that works for me because i find wool terribly itchy and this sweater is not. i love it!\n",
      "I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.\n",
      "Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.\n",
      "I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6\" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back\n",
      "Love this dress! it's so soft & not to short like some retailer dresses. great transition piece! i'm a fan of bell sleeves & can't wait to wear this with boots& tights this fall.\n",
      "The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.\n",
      "I usually wear a small, sometimes and extra small, so when i ordered this skirt in a small, i wasn't worried. when it arrived, there is no stretch whatsoever and i'd have to wear it really it high in order to zip it. not necessarily a bad look but it is a little uncomfortable (no give, stiff material). it is really pretty, bright color and the eyelets and slit are unique. might try the next size up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.\n",
      "The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back. it is absolutely beautiful!! the sweater is lightweight, perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day.. i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on sale.(unless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will.) i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater. the small was bit tight\n",
      "I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing!\n",
      "super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates, yoga, playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls.\n",
      "I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.\n",
      "I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8\" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)\n",
      "I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however, the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.\n",
      "I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.\n",
      "This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10\", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.\n",
      "This sweater drapes beautifully, but beware it is pretty light weight and feels more poly or nylon than wool. i dont know if you could wear a top with sleeves underneath either, it will probably work best with just a cami. that said, i love the style. note... the sweater is pretty long. i am 5'2 and normally 12-14p and the regular size came down to my knees. the lp was perfect, just covers my tush and has adequate room for curves.\n",
      "Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.\n",
      "This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference, i'm 5'6\", 120 lbs, 34c, and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted, and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.\n",
      "I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.\n",
      "This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al\n",
      "The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very \"blah,\" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "generally, it was interesting but not a \"most come home wit\n",
      "Such a pretty pink feminine blouse. love the sleeves! great quality and true to size.\n",
      "I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch, the fabric is very nice, i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!\n",
      "Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7\n",
      "I caught this on sale and bought the light pink version. it is very lightweight and delicate. i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape / design- but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy. it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekend. the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater- it does feel more\n",
      "I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.\n",
      "Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.\n",
      "After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool, i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine, and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer, rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved, high waist is flattering.\n",
      "regardi\n",
      "This chemise is so comfortable and beautiful. can be dressed up or down and is a staple of a bohemian wardrobe. gave 4 stars for the fact that it is completely see through and requires a (not included) slip underneath. also because the super thin cotton will wear easily.\n",
      "This sweater is really pretty. it is a little itchy, but seems really well made. i also like that you have the option of wearing it open with the tie tied in the back for some shape. a nice alternative to the basic cardigan.\n",
      "I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.\n",
      "Love this tee, purchased the blue and white, i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy, great for going out to dinner, etc...\n",
      "This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better, but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.\n",
      "I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.\n",
      "I love the color of this top. it is a dark olive green and elegant. i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans. it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time.\n",
      "I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.\n",
      "This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down! love it\n",
      "\n",
      "This sweater is quite lovely. the yarn is light and delicate and the sweater is over all very feminine and figure flattering. i bought the light red color which is quite attractive and i'm not usually a fan of reds and pinks. this sweater can be worn casually with jeans or more dressed up for the office. anyone that is looking for a sweater that can be worn with almost anything should defiantly consider this one.\n",
      "I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if\n",
      "This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.\n",
      "Love this one. i usually wear a medium, got this in medium and fits perfectly. i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms, they are a little snug, but i like the fit just as is. the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for.\n",
      "Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large., so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look, order down a size.\n",
      "The color of this t is beautiful and the shimmer is understated. very thin fabric, but should be fine.\n",
      "After reading the reviews, i ordered an xs and a s in this, though i usually wear an xs in bordeaux. i kept the xs. to me, the sleeves and shoulders run small, while the rest of the shirt is flowy through the torso. i prefer more fitted shirts, but decided this one looked ok. at 5'6\", the hem hit at my hip. i did not find it scratchy at all. in the pink, with a nude bra, it is not terribly see-through, but with a black bra, it is. i washed it in a lingerie bag and laid it flat to dry. maybe it s\n",
      "I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.\n",
      "I think this jacket is meant to be large on for a particular look. with an xs i had no problem. it's large, but slouchy and cute. i adore it!\n",
      "It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design\n",
      "Shimmery & lightweight t-shirts. i got the aqua & brown t's. good for layering.\n",
      "I bought the blue and the white - the white is very sheer. the fabric is more scratchy on the outside than the inside - i wore it the whole day and it was not an issue for me.\n",
      "This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.\n",
      "Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans, while still maintaining an elegant look.\n",
      "First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.\r\n",

      "the black design was strange - hearts, fox, cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well, but the black \"green\" design was too off.\n",
      "Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!\n",
      "My new go to skirt. great color for transitioning from summer to fall. i love the pockets and detailing, and yes, oh so soft...\n",
      "I knew from previous pilcro purchases to size down. went down 2 sizes and they fit perfect. this dark wash doesn't have as much stretch as some do which i prefer because they stay up all day.\n",

      "I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both, but sadly, the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all, a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces, but they were different angles, which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b\n",

      "Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom, but this was too cute to pass up. fits great, extremely flattering to my athletic build, super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3\" and did not have to hem it.\n",
      "I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it\n",
      "This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.\n",

(i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra, so usually braless is not an option, but this actually offers enough support. and, if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it. \r\n",

      "I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it's washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i've gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn't shed/pilled either. well-made, quirky and useful for layering!\n",

      "I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2\" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.\n",
      "Great fit. i love the slightly cropped leg and the dark, unvariating stain. fits like other pilcros. one caveat...the stain rubs off. i can see it on the edges of my white kitchen countertops. i've washed them twice with mixed clothing, and there weren't any problems with color transfer there. still, i like them so much that i'll buy a second pair if they go on sale, and i'll keep wiping the edges of my counters down!\n",
      "This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.\n",
      "Fits great and i love the length. very cute skirt!\n",
      "I really loved this skirt on the model, but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4, athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to. \r\n",

      "This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning it.\n",
      "I saw this on line this morning and was hesitant to order one size smaller so decided to visit local anthopology store with fingers crossed they would have it in a size 4. i'm 5'5 130 and a size 6 usually in retailer clothing. not only was the size 4 perfect the fabric and quality are excellent. nice flowy pant legs and the top has a one button adjustment on the shoulder if you don't want it too low. either way worked for myself. dress up or down. this is a must!\n",
      "I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass - they didn't look cute and i thought they wouldn't be cute on, because the little pockets looked droopy --but i was so wrong! once they went on sale, i took a chance b.c. i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip. ordered a size small and it fits perfect - so cute, i just love it! glad i bought it at the sale price because now i'm even happier!\n",
      "I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans, and have loved them all!!! these, unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit, just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a \"mom jean\" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.\n",
      "Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro, make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist, just prefer that better, but i think if you can pull of the waist look, go for it! would buy more in different colors!\n",

      "I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews, even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online, so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's \"party in the back.\" i'm 5'3\" so it was pretty much floor length on me.\n",

      "I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long, but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted, but still flattering, which surprised me! for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, and i got the size 24.\n",
      "I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large, i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too, it just looks so good on.\n",
      "I am not particularly fond of this skirt - it is good quality and nice color but i expected material to be little bit more substantial, it is too \"limp\" for my taste, but if you prefer very soft and \"worn in\" feeling, it might work great for you. also, i prefer wearing my ts over the skirt (not inside) and since waistband is very elaborate and is followed with thick buttons right below, it just looks funny under thin summer t-shirts : /. overall, just not working for me, but skirt is cute and tr\n",

      "These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4\" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans, not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.\n",
      "I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually, they are much too short, this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too\n",

      "I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4', 125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long, below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed, that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning\n",
      "I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that\n",

      "Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.\n",
      "I love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress.  i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties. i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans. worn loose or belted, it can be different every time you wear it. it does run large so you may want to size down.\n",
      "These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly, as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.\n",
      "I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.\n",
      "Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice, loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami, looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.\n",
      "I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer, unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this, and in my mind, that defeats the purpose of a lightweight, sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.\n",

      "Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!\n",
      "I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.\n",
      "I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously, how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear, but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft, comfy fabric. i\n",
      "I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting it...definitely a super weird cut. extreme a-frame. the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise. i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure. i am going to keep anyway. i've already worn it with jeans and a t-shirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress. it actually looked fantastic with both. i'll get a lot of wear out of it, just not the way\n",
      "I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.\n",
      "This dress is super cute. good quality. from the front it is very flattering and hangs well. from the side and back it looks huge. i ordered a size 4 and i am a normal 6 or 8. i have re-ordered the 0 and size 2 to see if there is less material (others have mentioned that the arms are smaller in the smaller size. my trouble area is my hips so i don't think this will be an issue as i am quite small on top). if not i will have it altered because it is so cute and can be worn many different ways.\n",
      "Agree 100% with other reviews. this dress flares a lot so it does resemble a tent. to size down causes a problem in the shoulders. i had to keep the 8 - which is what i usually wear to accommodate my broad shoulders but i love it so much i am having it altered to taper and adding the pockets you would expect a dress like this to have. at this price i am hoping it's worth it.\n",
      "I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.\n",
      "This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles. from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights, to donning a bolo and ankle boots, heads will turn when you walk into the room.\n",

      "Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they, firstly, aren't eloise like i assumed they would be, and secondly, that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure, but i'm\n",
      "I'm a 36ddd, and have a bust about 42\" so when i tried this on in a size 12, i honestly didn't expect to be able to squeeze it on... and yet i had inches upon inches to spare in the bust. this really is built more like a tent than a dress. on the bright side though, if you belt it, and gather the extra material at the sides it'll define your waist and the skirt has lots of swing and flounce to it. i do love a line styles!! \r\n",

      "Great dress in terms of material, quality, print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i\"m 5'5\" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed.\n",
      "Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.\n",
      "I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it. i love the tassel on the back at the tie. the fabric is not too sheer. the fit is loose and will be cool this summer.\n",
      "I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!\r\n",
      " like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8\" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down.\n",
      "Love this top!!!! it is just gorgeous and fits great!\n",
      "Larger than life in both size and personality. this one runs pretty big however the detailing in the fabric itself and embroidered collar balance that out. it's even more gorgeous in person! \r\n",
      "for reference, i'm 5'7\", 125lb, straight up and down and i usually go for a 4 or 6 / small. i got a 4, but could have easily fit into the 2 or even the 0.\n",

      "These are very cool leggings. the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging. they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit. i wore them for the first time today and really loved them. i didn't feel like i was out in \"leggings\" but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants. the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over - including the rear. they are definitely sculpting and firming. they fit the same size-wise as\n",
      "I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8, got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.\n",
      "Based on others' reviews, i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size. as others mentioned, it runs 1-2 sizes large. but, unlike others, i don't feel i need a belt at the waist. i am 5'2\" 140# 34d and with my body style (super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty) this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape!!!  and the design and quality are superb to boot!!!\n",
      "As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviews - great dress. i got a ton of compliments on it, but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in. not a fan of belts with dresses, but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in. not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer. i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo.\n",
      "Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b\n",
      "This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3\" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home.\n",
      "This dress is loose, unique, and super cute! you'll get noticed in this dress! i ordered down a size.\n",
      "I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.\n",
      "Based on the strength of the other reviews, i thought this sweater would be amazing, but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin, cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath\n",
      "Totally out of my style range but am totally enamored by this tent dress/shirt/coat thing! ok, so yes it's very very tenty, but fits on my shoulders (size down 1x or 2x if you're narrow shouldered) and i use one of my leather belts to gather the material and make myself a nice western fit & flare! like the model shots, this looks great with a tee and skinnies. if you have tried the marvelous silk santee swing dress, the escalante has the same amount of fabric that reviewer either love or hate. i\n",
      "I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.\n",
      "This is a great item! well made and heavier than it looks. size runs 2 sizes too small. it is great as a dress or open as a long shirt with jeans. i had my dressmaker put a dart right down the front under my breast to give a little more fit and less flare. this helps if you are curvy.\n",
      "I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k\n",
      "I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.\n",
      "These are great overalls - cute design but wish they came in petite! the big/straps were a little too big for me, so i had to return, but i probably could have had them tailored.\n",

      "I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference, i am 5'7\" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way, but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise, it's a great, casual piece. the material is light and soft, and it's cute over leggings.\n",
      "I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-35 and 5'4\" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't\n",

      "I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.\n",
      "Love this skirt, easy to wear and very flattering. looks better in person, i saw it at the store and bought it; when i looked at it on-line i didn't realize it was the same skirt. this is a \"go to\" skirt, comfy and sexy all in one! even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweater....super comfortable and still looked nice! great purchase!\n",
      "Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!\n",
      "I got this in black, size medium, my usual size. i am fairly \"curvy\" on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure. it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom & indeed through the body itself. since i'm slim there, i will have to tailor it, am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest. but i'm keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe. good job retailer!\n",
      "I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!\n",
      "I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!\n",
      "This jacket is perfect for fall! lightweight and easily worn over other tops or layers. looks great with jeans!\n",
      "Didn't notice the zipper in the back when i ordered this so it was a nice surprise\n",
      "These pants fit great, are soft, comfy, and flattering. i'm 5'7\" and the length is perfect in a medium. they wash well.\n",
      "I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!\n",
      "This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am, it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.\n",
      "These sleep pants are very pretty, soft and comfortable. unfortunately, after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?\n",
      "This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion, it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking \"maternity\". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i'm usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for\n",
      "This is a great top and got compliments already...it does have a longer sleeve like the picture, but\r\n",
      "really not bad. it's so comfortable and color is fabulous. great with any scarf too.\n",
      "Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt, made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly, air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.\n",
      "Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight, it's back, and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made, can go from business to sport to casual.\n",
      "I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft, like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.\n",
      "I tried this in the store after looking at it online. the material was soft and flexible which was nice - i had been concerned that it might be stiff. however, it was a bit difficult to get on and off with the zipper on the back and the high neckline. overall, as a petite person, i felt the spots were too overwhelming for me. but if you like the spots, and have no trouble with back zippers, go for it.\n",
      "I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.\n",
      "This jacket is a perfect, lightweight cover for dresses as shown online, but will also look great with jeans and tops. the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality. the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more form-fitted. while its a masculine style, its has feminine details and fit. this is my third hei hei jacket, the sizes between them are consistent (i'm 5'4'', 125lbs. 34c and i wear an xs in this jacket) - each one i've worn a million times!\n",
      "This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.\n",
      "This top is perfect! i'm 5'9\" and a medium build, and it's hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it's my new go to top!!\n",
      "Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper...\n",
      "This top is awesome. i purchased the gold color in a small. fits perfectly and true to size; sleeves are nice and long. definitely recommend!\n",
      "I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short, and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me, a redhead. i'm 5'3\", 125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.\n",
      "At 46 years old, i still like fun, hip, fashionable items, but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!\n",
      "Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.\n",
      "1. i'm 5'5\" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath, when zipped up. i plan on wearing tank tops or thin t-shirts under it, and leaving it unzipped. i'm normally a size 10, but at retailer, i'm a 12 in their jackets.\r\n",

      "I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.\n",
      "These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10\" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!\n",
      "I got the ivory. it's very cute under the split back cloth & stone button down denim in slightly oversized top (i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down). this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium. the top snags easily. it 's pricey but i love it.\n",
      "I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.\n",
      "Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.\n",
      "I really love this top. it's cute, whimsical, and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it's a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it, especially during the tag sale.\n",
      "Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8\" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is\n",
      "This shirt is amazing. it's soft, comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.\n",

      "Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.\n",
      "I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!\n",
      "Love these bottoms, cheekier than i thought but like them even more!\n",

      "I ordered this sweater online in a size 12. i am 5'7 170 i normally wear a 10/12, i was swimming in this one. i could have ordered an 8 and been fine. the fabric feels luxurious but the twist in the shoulder is not sewn into place, you will have to steam/press it each time you wear it or you could have it sewed into place.\n",
      "Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow, waaay too small.\n",
      "I found this at my local retailer. it is a beautiful unique sweater. it fits nicely a bit longer in the back and a tad loose on the bottom. i've gotten loads of compliments as it's truly special. i'm not sure why it's not sold out yet!\n",
      "Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9\" so normally wear medium. however, could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!\n",
      "The length of these pants is not quite long enough. i'm 5'8, and the only way i can make these work is if they're pulled low on the hips. it'd be nice if more brands offered long and short sizes in lounge\n",

      "but i still kept the xs\n",
      "Like the other reviewers, i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute, though! i'm 5'9\" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).\n",
      "I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.\n",
      "A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.\n",
      "Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger\n",
      "I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool. \r\n",

      "True to form, this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight, stylish, great for a shorter person like myself, and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long, but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater, too, but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one,\n",
      "Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket.  the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall.  runs tts.\n",

      "I was leary about ordering this but absolutely loved it when it arrived!  i found out the front could be the back and the back could be the front - reversible, right?  and the styling of the shirt was very complimentary to my body.\n",
      "I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit, but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing, but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha\n",

      "Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot\n",

      "Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!\n",
      "I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.\n",
      "I'm in love with this dress! i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i haven't seen a body that it doesn't look good on. i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didn't at all. this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet, i highly recommend it!\n",
      "I'm in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store. if you don't have enormous shoulders (which i do) , i think the petite would fit someone in the 5'6\" range. what i'm trying to say is the dress is pretty long. the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary. i've been reading marie kondo's book and this one \"sparks joy\"!\n",
      "I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i\n",
      "I had this in my cart for ages, waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general. i am delighted as it did finally go on sale, i bought it, and it is fabulous!!! my measurements are 36/28/39, i wear a 34d bra, and the small fit perfectly. the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about 3/8\" at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress. what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling, but the lining does not, hence the showing. i\n",
      "This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i haven't worn the navy yet, but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it isn't too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.\n",
      "I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4\" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to\n",
      "This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.\n",
      "I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.\n",
      "May look better on someone tall. thin, and straight.\n",
      "I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however, this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering, opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.\n",
      "I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an\n",
      "These pants are really pretty and comfrotable, and i took a cahnce ordering them with a \"31 inch inseam:, i thought perhaps they would work with a 4-inch heel...howeverm it is not the case, tey much be much longer than 31 inches. due to the cut out i will not be able to have htem hemmed, so htey must go back. if you are taller, i recommend, they are truly flattering.\n",
      "I got 2 of these dresses, one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 51 and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it's a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7\" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it's p\n",
      "I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....\n",
      "This dress is beautiful - it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture, if not prettier. it is a great material, the colors are beautiful, and it is perfect to throw on in the summer. i highly recommend it.\n",
      "This dress is made well and fit nice. i am 64\" and 135 lbs. i really wanted it keep it but it is going back. the colors in person are much more muted and with my pale blonde hair and fair skin the color was all wrong.\n",
      "Perfect summer dress! this is a must buy! it can be dressed up or down\n",
      "Super cute dress, the material is not what i expected. it's stretchy and the slip is tight fitting too. the look is super cute though!\n",
      "I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.\n",
      "This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.\n",
      "I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.\n",
      "I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31\" waist, 38.5\" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased.\n",
      "Love this top! tried on a small in the store as it was the only size the had. the sales person ordered me a medium on line. i am wearing it tomorrow for my birthday! the stretch fabric is very flattering.\n",
      "I was skeptical when i saw it online. i was not sure about the white background. but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online. i ordered s and xs. i was really surprised how well this dress fits. i am 5.4 and about 126 lbs, pear shape. the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy. the cut is slimming, flattering and structured. i decided to keep the xs size. i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer.\n",
      "Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.\n",
      "I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.\n",
      "I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.\n",
      "This dress is so flattering, i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream, so darn cute for summer, in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!\n",
      "As a petite, big busted woman, i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful, though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however, i found unflattering.\n",
      "Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me\n",
      "My review isn't really about the jeans! i want the top!\n",
      "Soft, silky, lined in silky natural fabric, hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite, but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes, so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!\n",
      "This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer! it's very comfortable and fashionable.\n",
      "I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!\n",
      "I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown.\n",
      "if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it.\n",
      "i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight.\n",
      "on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight.\n",
      "This dress is just what i was looking for. i ordered it in late summer. it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day! it's so comfortable, and just the right length. i wore it with leggings and boots, but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring.\n",
      "I love this tank top...the fringe on the bottom is fun, and i've gotten many compliments on it already...i think it runs true to size :-)\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress. it has great detail and is well made. the tassles are very heavy which is kind of funny because the dress is light and airy. it is pretty, cute and sexy all in one dress!\n",
      "Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :)\n",
      "I absolutely love this dress. it's flattering and feminine. you will love it. it runs large so size down.\n",
      "Loved the dress on-line. ordered a petite small. fits perfectly. i am barely 5'5\" and carry my weight in hips and thighs. this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt!! so, if you are a pear shape, get this dress!!\n",
      "Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2\", 110, 32-24.5-32.\n",
      "I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.\n",
      "Such a beautiful, flattering dress! i bought this to wear for our anniversary dinner and received so many compliments.\n",
      "I love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary. this tops does that for me: the black is a rich dark charcoal grey, the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well. however, the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff (my problem) area. since i love it so much, i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large. it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline.\n",
      "Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips.\n",
      "I understand the style of this dress is \"swing\", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.\n",
      "A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics, scarves and jewelry. so, i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses, even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived, i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes, so it is going back asap.\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous, flattering, oood quality and, in my opinion, better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black, rather than nude liner, which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on, practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug, though, but at least it's stretchy. that being said, it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa\n",
      "I'm stunned by the bad reviews by others. i love this dress! it is an amazing, feminine, detailed, exceptional work of art, and lucky for me -- who usually takes 14s and 16s -- that it runs big. there is stretch to it, and it fits great! lucky, lucky me.\n",
      "Great quality and cut! they are so versatile, which i love! highly recommend these!\n",
      "I am tall (5'11 and 3/4) and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio. i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them. i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be. however there was no need to alter these tops (making me think the tops typically run small). \r\n",

      "both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b\n",
      "This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.\n",
      "Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.\n",
      "If you have muscular thighs, like me, these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed, i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely \"relaxed\" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering.\n",
      "This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it's surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.\n",
      "This is one fabulous-looking dress; however, the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up, to see if that would help, but it was still too scratchy for me.\n",
      "Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o\n",
      "This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle, which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.\n",
      "These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!\n",
      "If it's a knock off, its of the \"poise\" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!\n",
      "I love this style and was pleasantly surprised that it fit my curvy shape well, despite it being a fairly straight shift style. it does wrinkel easily because of the linen fabric, but otherwise is really perfect! it is dressy enough for bridal showers or brunches but could also be worn casually.\n",
      "Very comfortable,  looks great on. like the color & fabric. something you can throw on & go\n",
      "Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs, purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!\n",
      "This dress is navy and neutral stripes. not black and white. it fits true to the size width wise but is 2-3 inches shorter than the picture. to gain the length you might want to size up but it will be wider. the knot at the hip is beautiful and very flattering.\n",
      "I'm so glad to own this one. i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro. true to size, perfect color.\n",
      "high waisted and flare just right. can be paired with cropped top or peasant top. looking taller on this outfit!\n",
      "best of all i got it on sale!\n",
      "The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4\" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31\" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch, the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.\n",
      "I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it\n",
      "I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.\n",
      "Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back.\n",
      "I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3\") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin\n",
      "This coat is gorgeous. the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type!\r\n",

      "Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.\n",
      "I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.\n",
      "I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3\", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not\n",
      "I was hesitant to order high rise pants, seems they only ever look good on a tall person. but these worked out perfect, i'm barely 5'6\", and the pants are just as long on me as the model in the picture, just barely brushing the floor when i'm in heels, though if i'm honest they do touch down a bit which will scuff them most likely, but to tailor 1/4 inch seems ridic. love them, super sexy, slimming, and elegant, the color is rich and the material is not too thick or thin, very comfortable stretc\n",
      "I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5\", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months.\n",
      "This top definitely looks better in person. i thought it looked pretty online, but when i tried it on, it looked even better! this top is on the longer side and fits like it looks on the model. the fabric is perfect in my opinion because i don't have to 1) dry clean it, 2) iron it, or 3) worry about it itching or bothering my skin. i am 5'8\", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i purchased a size xs and it drapes wonderfully. i love the crochet around the neckline, the 3/4 length sleeves, and the colors of the\n",

      "Love these jeans!! i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away! i ordered the 26 regular.\n",
      "yes, they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2\"# for flats, but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2\" - 3\" to wear with these).\n",
      "the fit is comfortable, they stretch just enough to look nice and still move with you. they are not binding at all.\n",

      "i stopped wearing pants about 4 years ago. i could never find any that would fit over my thighs/hips that weren't too loose on my waist. took a chance with these after looking at the measurements and they fit perfect. higher waist than i'm used (sits just above my natural waistline) to with any of my skirts, but i'll get used to it. they're also too long to wear with any flats. being that i bought them for winter, i'll be perfectly fine with heeled bo\n",
      "These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.\n",
      "I loved this skirt. the material is so fun and a love the pattern. unfortunately they didn't have the size i needed so it had to go back to the store\n",
      "I don't know why i had the opposite problem most reviewers had with these..... i tried on the regular length in the store and found that they were just a bit too short with heels. (i'm 5'5 ). i had them ordered in a petite and when they came, they were too short with flats! maybe it's the way i like to wear them, i like my flare jeans to barely skim the ground. i just exchanged them for regular length and will wear them with a small wedge shoe. aside from the length issues, these are super cute\n",
      "These were as great in person as i had hoped; great color for fall, super comfy and flattering fit. happy with my purchase!\n",
      "I ordered this in a regular medium even though i am short i never order petite pants as the crotch is always too short...but this crotch is very long.....i have exchanged for a medium petite and hopefully that will work. i have last years short denim romper by the same brand and did not run into this issue.\n",
      "I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!\n",
      "Just got this dress in the mail yesterday and i love the style and fabric soooo much!!! the fabric looks kind of shiny in the photos so i wasn't quite sure, however in person it's a perfect blend that can easily be dressed up or down. sadly i cannot fully see how it looks on me because the bust of it is way too small. i normally wear a 0 or 2 in a dress and am a 32c but the inside panel that you cannot see in any of the photos is very fitted to the chest and i cannot even zip the size 2 over my\n",
      "This top is very flattering and the silver line details give it a great pop of color!\n",
      "I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.\n",
      "I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.\n",
      "I agree with other reviewer, the material of these jeans is not the same! thin, stretches, and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short, curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.\n",
      "I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big, so between true to size and big. it is both flattering and stretchy. the waist comes in nicely, the sleeves are not annoying, and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion. length was right above the knee.just. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist for reference...\n",
      "I received this jacket in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size so i ordered the s & m. i opened the medium first and found that to fit me well. i never tried the small on. fyi, i am 5'5\", 125 lbs. & 34a in the chest. it allowed some \"give\" room for layering, like the picture of the model. this is a very cute jacket, no doubt about it. i like the combo of the linen with the leather. the outside of the jacket is well constructed. the reason i put 4 stars and said \"but\" is because of the unfini\n",
      "I am 5'8\" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)\n",
      "For reference, i'm 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a \"mixed-media/material\" type. for example, it's linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area,\n",
      "I'm 5' 2\" and 110 lbs. i ordered this in xsp but it was a lot shorter in the front than led to believe from the photo. it was also a little baggy on top. otherwise, i love the material, shimmer and overall look. i will be exchanging this for a regular xxs.\n",
      "Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.\n",
      "I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat\n",
      "This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.\n",
      "When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.\r\n",
      "i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.\n",
      "I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here, but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.\n",
      "I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.\n",
      "This shirt arrived today, and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary, and if i order it again, it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size, xs petite. i'm 5-2\", so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store, i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!\n",
      "I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i\n",
      "This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)\n",
      "Love everything about these! they are super fostering and comfy. i am a busy mom and need comfort. these are a great addition to my closet. super cute with booties, wedges and flats.\n",
      "They fit me great, are super comfortable. they are casual, yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online, too\n",
      "This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either, but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it\n",
      "I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand, but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft, light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring, winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size, i am 36d, 31\" waist and 5' 2\" so i ordered a large and it fi\n",
      "I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately, when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.\r\n",

      "it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th\n",
      "I agree with the previous review that this dress runs large. otherwise, it is a lovely dress, though i added a belt since the tie wasn't defining enough for me. brown leather looks great with it and i get tons of complements.\n",
      "This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute \"lounge at the lake\" ensemble.\n",
      "I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.\n",
      "In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.\n",
      "This is an adorable little top. the tank has such beautiful detailing on the chest. the flowers are more red than pink. i found it to be tts on me.. the tank is flowy and loose.\n",
      "This dress is great! it's perfect for a casual look with a denim jacket, comfortable for traveling, and can even be dressed up for a more formal occasion. i wore it on a cross country flight (toronto-british columbia) and was so comfortable with a sweater and scarf to wrap around me if i got cold. the only con i found of this dress is the back is a bit low leaving your bra showing and being a 32-d i don't feel comfortable going without a bra. i purchased a few of the bralettes to go with it to m\n",
      "I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10\"). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,\n",
      "This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.\n",
      "These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.\n",
      "Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.\n",
      "I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.\n",
      "This top is so lovely. the fabric is thick and soft, and the drape is phenomenal. i did size down based on reviews, i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect, nice and flowy and very flattering.\n",
      "This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft, embroidery beautiful, fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction, and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color, most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas, any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.\n",
      "The embroidery details on this top are beautiful. the material is soft and a really good quality. my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments! i love it!\n",
      "I tried on the pink in xs in store. it was so big on me. i wanted to love it, the stylist did, but i felt meh... so did another costumer, didn&#39;t like it on me. the colors are really nice (and the blue seems really nice too), but the cut was a little wide. fabric is very soft. for reference, i am 115 lbs, 0dd, 26.5 in waist.\n",
      "Love this dress, the colors are stunning, the make is beautiful...i don't know where to start. the body part is a nice neutral color, and has beautiful beading, my concerns is snagging since the fabric is so flowy and the beading pokes out sort of... i love that they used different patterns on the layers, the skirt bottom layer has cute polka dots that are translated on the sleeves (bottom of the sleeves). sleeves, are, by the way, fun and bubble-like. the cut of the dress is not following the b\n",
      "Based on other reviews i had no doubt this dress would be perfect.  it truly is a work of art, however it just wasn't \"me\" when i tried it on.  i'm sure for others it will be perfect.  my biggest issues were the sheerness of the top portion, which is obvious in the photos.  i was hoping it would be less obvious in person.  also the elbows of the dress were tight, so it was difficult to bend my arms, and i have pretty slender arms.\n",
      "Nice jacket, good quality, flattering design. i'm 5\"4\", 115 lbs, bought a size s and fits well. love the hood. a little snug in the arms if you want to wear a long sleeve underneath. overall a good buy!\n",
      "Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the \"boho peasant\" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected) , she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off.\n",
      "disappointing as picture makes it much prettier.\n",
      "I ordered a size xl. it's flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it's true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn't work for my complexion so i'll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl\n",
      "The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.\n",
      "This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would \"hang\" appropriately and \"swing\" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.\n",
      "I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.\n",
      "Just got this in the mail today. very pretty, soft and comfortable. i could probably have sized down, but it fits fine. for reference, i'm 5'4\", 138 lbs and i got an xs. grab this while it's on sale!\n",
      "I'm not sure what cup size i am, 36b or 36c, but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public, but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops, but the medium worked for those too.\n",
      "The weight and feel of this jacket is what i was hoping for. it is medium weight making it my go to on cool days and is also very flattering to wear...it actually gives you shape! i like the front texturing on the scroll work and the pockets are well placed. if anything could be different, i would have preferred a little more room in the sleeves as they run slightly snug so not made to wear with anything with bulk, but overall not an issue.\n",
      "This dress is stunning. it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art. it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way. i think is would flatter any body type. the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a room.\r\n",
      "i ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with it's exotic use of fabrics, textures.....a rare find and a must have.\n",
      "Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.\n",
      "This top is beautiful on, it has very feminine detail and is very flattering. the first time i wore it i got 4 compliments on it. i would definitely recommend!\n",
      "I originally bought this in medium, my normal size. when it arrived, it was absolutely huge, like wearing teepee. i took it back to the store, and re ordered a small, in the black, and now it fits great. this is a great shirt, but giving four stars due to the inconvenience.\n",
      "This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms, or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms, this top may not be for you.\n",
      "I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. \r\n",
      "this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.\r\n",
      "i can definitely see getting a lot of wear\n",
      "I love this dress, i love the style, i love the pattern, i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however, i think it runs a little large, particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature, and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds, 5'5\", and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small, but i went with my usual size in dresses\n",
      "This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs, which i nesrly always wear, but i measure 35\" in the bust and it fits well, but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value.\n",
      "I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.\n",
      "This is such a beautiful top. i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape. also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust. sadly, returning.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it!\n",
      "This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!\n",
      "I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however, when i received it, its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally, i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2, 30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted, but its definitely not.\n",
      "This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.\n",
      "This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest, and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture, the top appears to have a white background, but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8\", 145, and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top, and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering\n",
      "This top is a perfect example of why retailer is heaven. the attention to detail is stunning and it drapes beautifully. i am 5'6\" and 140lbs with an average build. an xs fits me perfectly. this top is very flowy. i could wear it until about six months into a pregnancy, yet it is flattering even though i am not currently adding to the human race. it's an investment, but it's high quality and worthy of the price tag.\n",
      "The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!\n",
      "I tried this one on twice before i committed to it, but i'm so glad i did!! this top has a lot of volume. it is fitted in the arms (but stretchy), has quite a large neckhole (but lays beautifully on my neck and shoulders), and has a lot of volume on bottom. what i love about it is the variance in length at the hem. it's long in the front and back, then comes up on the sides. this makes the top really feminine and lovely! it's the perfect top for women who carry weight in their belly or butt...i\n",
      "I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul\n",
      "I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big, but with a longish shirt it's fine. also, they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!\n",
      "This is so beautiful! i loved it online, but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!\n",
      "The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really, really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn't enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it.\n",
      "This top is super comfortable and has a great preppy casual look. i have been wearing it on weekends with jeans, but could also pair it with a skirt and tights to have a more work type look. i don't usually like the shorter length shirts, but the fit on this works for me.\n",
      "Saw this online and didn't catch my attention, but saw it in store and decided to try it on. really cute and comfy on. the fabric feels so soft. it runs very big.\n",

      "In the photo i loved the colors. in person though, the print on mine had the four huge pink lily flowers on the front and it just wasn't the look i was hoping for, like the photo. also, i failed to notice in the photo that there's elastic along the seam of the butt! this seems silly and unnecessary.... it's not terribly noticeable on, but still i felt weird. the fabric is thick and not see-thru and the quality is fine, but the combination for the shifted print and the unexpected ruching and thes\n",

      "This dress, it is heartbreakingly gorgeous, stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves, embroidery and slight shimmer at the top, two layers underneath, the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!\n",

      "I love this cardigan! its fit, however, really depends a lot on an individual's height and build. i am about 150 lbs. i have slim arms and am larger in the chest. my typical size in retailer clothing is m. having said that, i found that in this top a s fit best. it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay. the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed. wearing leggings or slim pants (ex. pilcro cords) gave a much more flattering look to my backside. jeans...not so muc\n",
      "This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.\n",
      "Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason, i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me, it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.\n",
      "This is figure featuring without being too tight. it fits exactly like the picture. it is a bit pricey, but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan. i love it!\n",
      "So soft and comfy.  fits great, love the length.  i am sure it will get much wear, great addition to my wardrobe.\n",
      "I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i didn't want to take it off.\n",
      "This is the softest cardigan i own. perfect for lounging, going to / from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf. i've worn it buttoned or open, and receive many compliments. i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment : )\n",
      "I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty, intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material, this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i\n",
      "Love wearing these, i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter\n",
      "I don't have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it\n",
      "I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4\" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4\", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m.\n",
      "I love this dress, it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person, 5'4\" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me, but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.\n",
      "I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.\n",
      "I love this dress. my favorite retailer purchase in years. it is perfect. looks great- no need for ironing and is really sexy for the length and amount of material. i would buy it 10 more times if i could. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "yes!\n",
      "These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.\n",
      "Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .\n",
      "This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it's really stretchy fabric too. i'm a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted, so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.\n",
      "\n",
      "the other thing that's nice is that for short people like me (i\"m between 5'2\" and 5'3\") it doesn't drag on the ground; in fact it fits me\n",
      "This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material, but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately, i must return it.\n",
      "Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated. my husband loves them on me. for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer. i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t.\n",
      "I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!\n",
      "I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m, which is my normal retailer size, but couldn't move my arms. took it back, was going to try in a l, but store didn't have any. for the price, i need to be able to move my arms!\n",
      "I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured\n",
      "Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!\n",
      "This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s\n",
      "I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.\n",
      "Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.\n",
      "Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b\n",
      "I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!\n",
      "The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8\" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.\n",
      "First i definitely understand why most reviewers either adore or hate this dress. luckily for me it worked in my favor although i will point out the downsides too. (1) it runs small. the only reason i was able to fit my usual size is because i have a tiny bust and have been working to tone up. but still i had to maneuver to get the sidezip up. i would size up but....(2) being that this dress runs small it appears more fitted on top as if it were a fit and flare or bustier which i like. (3) you h\n",
      "I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.\n",
      "When i first saw this online, i knew i had to have it. so, when dresses were 25% off, i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy, but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7, 140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans, xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.\n",
      "I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured.\n",
      "Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on, but can be worn in a versatile way, and if you are small chested, without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material, i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!\n",
      "I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece\n",
      "Very versatile skirt that's suitable for any occasion or any season.\n",
      "This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations. very unique and well-made. swing dresses can be a hit or miss, sometimes, but this one is perfect. couldn't be happier!\n",
      "This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.\n",
      "I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.\n",
      "I love the cardigan. it's super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it's a little tight in the arms. i'm right between a small and medium, i wish i would have ordered the medium.\n",
      "Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.\n",
      "Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.\n",
      "This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.\n",
      "I'm 5'2, 105lbs and bought xsp. seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover, but not bad enough to return. everywhere else fits tts. nothing stunning about it, but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual. it would be better if there are more colors to choose from.\n",
      "I love the fit of the stevie jean. they are not too tight to make them inappropriate for a mom/teacher, but are definitely not your momma's jeans either. i have two pair (gray and a dark denim) and both fit perfectly after a wash. however, the waist stretches out throughout the day enough that i have to wear a belt which i never do! i could probably size down, but i didn't want the thighs to be too tight. for reference i'm 5'2\" 130 lbs. and wear a pretty standard 2, sometimes 4. i bought these i\n",
      "Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.\n",
      "These are a great dark wash and they fit true to size to every other stevies i own. for reference i am 5'6\", 145lbs, size 6/m and the 29 fit perfect. they are a bit long but i fold them up and it looks just as cute. i highly recommend especially since they are on sale, definitely a closet staple.\n",
      "This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.\n",
      "Reviews said it ran small so i ordered a size up, was large on me. nicely made, but wanted something a little smaller.\n",
      "This feels so nice and light and summery. nothing like a crisp white top for the season.\n",
      "Great for work, great for play. i love this shirt. perfect length for tuck in or not.\n",
      "This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it, styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!\n",
      "As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.\n",
      "....but not for me. i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in, but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs. right out of the bag, i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper. however, i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on. from the pictures, it looks like there is a small opening, but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back. this may not be the same for a taller person s\n",
      "I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.\n",
      "I am beyond pleased with this dress. photos do not do it justice and no, it does not look like a gown. it is comfortable, forgiving, and will be a staple for years to come. i am 5' 11\" and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size. this is my first maxi dress and i'm thrilled. do not miss this piece, it is special!\n",
      "I bought the blue & black, they are great basics. got the small. i am normally a extra small in retailer.\n",
      "Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it doesn't look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.\n",
      "I purchased this dress before reading any of the reviews. i ended up reading them the day the dress was to arrive---and they worried me, since i was so excited for this dress! i put it on and i feel like it is not much different from the photo here online. it is meant to be roomy. it is more fitted on top, and the back is cute to give it some shape too. but it is meant to be loose fitting. i personally love it. i have added a belt to give it more shape when i want, worn it on its own, or with a\n",
      "I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.\n",
      "Definitely size up...possibly two sizes. i can often wear an xs and the s is skin tight on me. other than that, it's a nice neutral piece.\n",
      "The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!\r\n",

      "wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels.\n",
      "I'm a rather small person--5'2\", about 100 lbs, 32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place, i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs, planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee, but even as petite as i am, i coul\n",

      "This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!\n",
      "I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it.\n",
      "Although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders, i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute\n",
      "As of late, it's been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fit's true-to-size. i'm 5'2\" and 107 lbs. and i've had to return several pieces because they were too big on me. this versatile piece fits true-to-size. i purchased an xsp. like the previous reviewer, i've tried this with a couple of different long-sleeve shirt and tights combinations. i think this will work in the spring and fall, too as the material is in between heavy and light/airy. great for work.\n",
      "Such a beautiful top, i understand why other reviews suggested wearing it out. personal i love pretty sleepwear, so i will be wearing this and matching shorts to bed. i ordered a small in both and they seem to run true to size. i am 130lbs and 5'5\". my regular size is small or a size 4. i love the embroidery and the pink!\n",

      "I absolutely love this shirt! i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it. all they had in stock was a size 2 and a size 8. i'm usually a 4-6 in button-up shirts, but i tried the 2 anyway and found it to be quite generously sized. i have a 32dd bust, so button-up shirts rarely fit me properly. this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in, and was loose-fitting without being sloppy. when i discovered that it came in petite sizes, i asked the so to order t\n",
      "This ribbed henley is incredibly soft. you'll love the way it feels, but it does run a little small so i'd recommend getting one size up if you don't want it to be too form fitting.\n",
      "I think this top is great. it does show cleavage. also, it's very romantic. i can't wait to wear it. if only the store had had the red and wine colors in stock too.\n",
      "I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.\n",
      "The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it, and a slip dress underneath. this way, the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture, or left ope\n",
      "Like the color and the dotted fabric. the length is good. the fabric on the back is a nice touch. fits well and hangs well.\n",

      "I loved the cut and style of this shirt, so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it, get it in a size larger.\n",
      "This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.\n",
      "This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest.\n",
      "I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0\" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite.\n",
      "I originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color, which is lovely and vibrant. the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering. however, it is also very, very cheap. after about five washes, it has pilled and worn, the color has faded a bit, and i doubt it will make it through the spring. for perspective, i wash all my clothes on cold and use the \"air dry\" setting on my dryer.\n",

      "The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.\n",
      "I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.\n",
      "I'd seen this in the store pre-sale and was delighted to see it on sale. i'm 5'4\", 125 lbs and prefer a looser fit, so went with the medium, as i expect that it may shrink a bit. but i appreciated the creative take on a classic look, good quality of the fabric, and this will go with everything in the summer. or even beforehand -- with a cardigan.\n",
      "This lounge robe is the most fantastic, dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3\" 36dd and 140#.\n",
      "I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt, which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still, the quality seemed to be good.\n",
      "Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.\n",
      "Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s, but that would be cutting it, especially since i'm 5ft 11in, 133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.\n",
      "I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.\n",
      "The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.\n",
      "I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.\n",

      "Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.\n",
      "This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee\n",
      "The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.\n",
      "I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.\n",
      "I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!\n",

      "Unfortunately, the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up, unbuttoned, like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.\n",
      "I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.\n",
      "This was long on me (i'm 5'1\") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.\n",
      "The pattern on this dress is even more beautiful in person. as reviewers mention, the dress is sheer, but a nude slip underneath is an easy fix. can't wait to pack this dress for my next beach getaway!\n",
      "The fit is true to size. the quality is nice. i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet!\n",
      "This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.\n",
      "Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also \"curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.\n",
      "This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10\" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium\n",
      "It's cute. it works with jeans, linen pants, flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a \"must have\". but i'm keeping it because it works!\n",
      "The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up, but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine), but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely, unique beach dress, this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!\n",
      "I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.\n",
      "I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4\" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.\n",
      "This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!\n",
      "I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2\", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th\n",
      "It runs long for a 5'1\" woman like me:) other than that beautiful dress for vacation\n",
      "I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.\n",
      "I am happy with my decision to buy this dress! it's casual, comfortable and my favorite color, too. this product is true to size, color and the material feels great.\n",
      "I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors\n",
      "I love how comfortable this fits and the fantastic pops of color. goes with just about every slip and tank dress i own! a perfect lightweight dress or layering vest with my hot weather wardrobe. can't wait to take this with me on vacation!\n",
      "I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act\n",
      "When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.\n",
      "This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over. \r\n",
      "i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.\n",
      "This dress is more of a lounge dress for at home even a belt and nice shoes would. it make it ok for day. 5$2 back is way longer than the front, more so than shown in the picture and the material is not substantial but for a lounge dress or swim\r\n",
      "coverup it is fine.\n",
      "These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!\n",
      "I gave only 4 stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer. unless you are very unmodest, you will need to wear a slip. \r\n",
      "i am 6 feet and it hits just above my ankle. slits on side and front. i know it is 'supposed to' be use as a beach cover-up..but forgot that! this is way too pretty not to wear out at night(with a slip {:>). \r\n",
      "i am not a fan of the tie waist, so i at wear a belt to cover it. \r\n",
      "overall, i recommend. enjoy!\n",
      "I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.\n",
      "This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.\n",
      "This is a beautiful dress. it's a great weight, unique pattern, and has gorgeous colors. it's fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom. i am a 10 or 12 in pants, 10 dress right now and i bought the 12. i am 5'8\" and 175 lbs, and 36c - also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing... also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath. i love it and bought it at\n",
      "I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is \"diaphanous,\" but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit\n",
      "I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured, but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette, but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally, the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses, but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful, and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of\n",

      "\n",
      "This dress in orange is lovely. it's very light weight which i was slightly disappointed by, i prefer heavier dresses. but it'll be good for spring and summer. it still seems to be constructed well. i'm 5'8\" and 170 and the 8 i purchased is a little too tight. so i'm thinking it may run a little smaller than some other dress brands i have from retailer. 8 is usually my go to size. a 10 would have probably been perfect.\n",
      "White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.\n",
      "Bought this on a whim, cocoon sweaters usually do not work for me. this cardigan is very cute, more of a dark gray. if it they carry again, grab it!\n",
      "The cascadia cardigan is a flattering piece that is perfect for fall. arms are longer, which i appreciate being 5'8\". the backside is on the shorter side. overall really love this piece.\n",
      "I'm glad i tried this on in the store because it runs very large. i usually wear a large and i ended up buying a small. the blue color is very striking. i plan to use it as a cover up and sightseeing dress this summer.\n",
      "I think this fits to true to size. i am 5\"2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust.\n",
      "I really like this top! excellent over a casual dress!! perfect for spring, summer and fall!\n",
      "Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.\n",
      "I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted \"just another cover-up\". in the final analysis, even at $35 (30% off 49.99), it just hung there. if that's what you're after, then this is for you.\n",
      "Love this little number. very flattering, warm, and soft. color goes with everything, i tried it on with a slip dress, and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite, and it fit like a glove, with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite, as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small, but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on.\r\n",

      "This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.\n",
      "This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.\n",
      "Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.\n",
      "The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite pieces. simple, classy, and cozy!\n",
      "I've purchased these in the past and found that they wear well, so i came back for some new colors this year. i ordered blue, holly (a deep olive-y green), and grey to try, and found that they all fit slightly different. the navy fit me perfectly in a size 27 (i'm 5'4\", 120 lbs), but the holly cords were tight in the legs, and i couldn't button the top. the grey was somewhere in between. i also felt like the grey showed more lumps and bumps. the navy is super flattering.\n",
      "I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9\" tall), 32d chest. i liked it, it was comfortable, but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end, i d\n",

      "I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i can't, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a\n",
      "This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately, it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes, ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.\n",
      "Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!\n",

      "I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.\n",

      "I typically wear xs or s, or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big, it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.\n",

      "How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo\n",
      "I tried this jacket on in store, both m & l. both seemed to pull a little at waist/pocket (notice the raised pleat on the closeup. i ordered xl on line. it fits better but still seems to fit like the other two when fastened. snaps seem to be misplaced. on the plus side, the style is cute and there is brown (taupe) mixed in with the grey which is more flattering to brownettes. there isn't much difference in sizing of all three. i am not sure whether this is a keeper. open, it is fine and casual;\n",

      "Love, love, love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style, it's very soft, very flattering, and very comfortable. fits tts, and the fabric is a very soft, stretchy cotton, yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice, flowy fit#. it washes great, doesn't pill #again, the fabric is fantastic), and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year, but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin\n",
      "I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while. i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years. in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality. but not this little pilcro jacket. great quality, perfectly proportioned, great understated details. many thanks retailer for restoring my faith.\n",

      "There is a reason everyone is giving this dress 5 stars. it is stunning, flattering, versatile and comfortable. i'm a slim, athletic size 4-6. my store only had one of these and it was a medium. i'm generally a small but on the hanger it looks like a slim tube so i thought i'd try it. fits fabulous. due to the stretch and shape of the dress i'd say a size medium could fit a 4-10. so, don't worry about sizing up or down one in this dress. suuuuuper stretchy so even though it fits close down throu\n",
      "This is a nice, soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear. the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt. although the shirt seems more fitted on the model, i found it to run large. if you are going for the same look, you might want to size down. however, i like the shirt and am keeping it. it is a good thing too, because the navy color went fast. very nice shirt and a pretty good price too.\n",

      "This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.\n",

      "I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5\" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it.\n",

      "Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work\n",
      "I own several of these tops and i love them. i am 5'10, 140 lbs and i wear a small. i bought the gray and white stripe and the ivory and black stripe and they are very flattering. the front hits me at the same place as it does on the model and the back covers my butt. i own several of the solid colors in this style as well and they are just as great. this shirt is so soft and comfortable, you won't regret buying it!\n",
      "I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!\n",
      "These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.\n",
      "This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body, but does not squeeze. it is super soft, smooth, and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!\n",

      "I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.\n",
      "The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat, vest, or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.\n",
      "I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust, so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find, as i did, that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size, and were lots younger, it could have worked for a dress with tigh\n",

      "My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on, and how they fit, and she brought this dress in, with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug, highlight every bump, and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.\n",

      "Wow. bailey 44 knocks it out of the park with this sensual, i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut\n",

      "This is a cute pair of jeans. it has a slight flare and just right amount of fringe. they are super soft and and the color is slightly lighter than in photos. tts, not too low hitting right below belly button and a just the right crop length for my 5'4\" height falling ri right above my ankle.\n",
      "This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2\". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.\n",
      "I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable.\n",
      "i'm 5'1\" , 107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer\n",
      "The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.\n",
      "Cute jacket, but size didn't work on me. 5'4, 135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops, but m in jackets. ordered the medium, but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer, but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.\n",
      "True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return.\n",

      "Yeah i know that sounds ridiculous. but this is really a nice piece, the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes. the color is perfect, a mid-deep indigo with just enough fading. i don't find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off, and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie. that said, it does run small. i'm usually a 6/28 and started off with a m. it was pretty form fitting, and the ct risk was at orange level. then the zipper wouldn't stay u\n",
      "I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality, as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.\n",
      "What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.\n",
      "I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline, thanks to having given birth, but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.\n",

      "I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!\n",
      "This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable. i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it. i am 5 feet tall and it does run a little long on me, a petite small hits me slightly below the knee. however, the dress is so nice that i am keeping it.\n",
      "I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return), i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.\n",
      "This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.\n",
      "Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.\n",
      "This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!\n",
      "This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.\n",
      "Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner\n",
      "I love this skirt, in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however, being suede, the skirt was very bulky. also, at 5'8\" and liking skirts to be long enough for work, i typically don't have problems with long length. however, i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they'll make some updates in future styles.\n",
      "After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying \"off the shoulder\" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!\n",
      "Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.\n",

      "I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos, size 0 in most pants , 25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.\n",
      "I could not tell from the picture but it is see through. it will be fine with a tank top i just was not expecting to need one.\n",

      "I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit, particularly in the bust area, but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all, and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference, i am 5'2\" 110lbs 32dd, and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material\n",
      "I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2\") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.\n",

      "Like other reviewers have stated, this dress does run small on the chest. i'm 5.3\", 32c, 120lbs and size 2 fits me great. however, if my chest size had been, like 34d and up, size 2 will not fit me although i'm petite frame. so, if you have a large chest, i would recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up. if you are like myself, small bust person, then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better. i was going to try size zero, however as soon as i tried size 2, i rea\n",
      "I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6, i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace, the length, color and detail on this one. it's also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:)\n",
      "I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress, but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large, but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue, which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton, but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme\n",
      "Ok, here is the story: i am 5'5\", 118 lb, 34c. i got a 4 and a 6, both are s tad tight at the chest and shoulder area, but i have big shoulders; i am keeping the 6. there is plenty material at the waist and below, but the dress does not look frumpy, at least on me it does not. i like the picture with the belt and i will wear it that way too. i also like the sleeves, they make it easier to wear at work. the material is lovely and so is the embroidery and cut-out. it really is a sweet summer dress\n",
      "Despite the mixed reviews, i went ahead and bought this in my normal size. i am small-chested (34b) and found this to fit perfectly, so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top. the fabric and detail are stunning on this. there is not a lot of give to the fabric, but if you are smaller in the bust. buy it!\n",
      "I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual, 2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown, so it is not constricting at all.\n",
      "I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe, and while the color didn't disappoint, everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin, i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear, but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...\n",
      "I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!\n",

      "i ordered a small although i really needed a petite small, but it was sold out. it is incredibly billowy. very billowy. i love the print and the material but this dress is just so very voluminous. i may have it professionally shortened since i am only 5' and the dress hits just below my knees. i'm hoping that helps since i'd really love to keep it.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful in person, the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses, but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room, but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part, it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we\n",
      "... runs large which is the opposite of what i see in the majority of others' reviews. since most reviews say it runs true to size i decided to purchased a size 28 which usually, it's the perfect size for me no matter which brand, fabric, style, etc. it always fits... well, not in this case. i should have gotten a size 27. i felt very disappointed because these pants are beautiful. i got the 40% off sale at the time and now can't exchange it since the price has changed and the product is unavail\n",
      "I ordered the peach version in size xl. it fit true to size--matched the photos online. i hand washed it and it did shrink a bit. the fabric & knit used are so soft. the color is so pretty too.\n",
      "I'm 5'-4\", 130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also, the straight across, rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown, not a hundred dollar dress.\n",
      "This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.\n",
      "I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine, and would be a great causal layering piece. however, there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam, and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention, unless you're built very narrow, the pockets will fall at, and accentuate hips, and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit, the layered style, with a cottony lined hood and \"faux\" lay\n",
      "I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.\n",
      "This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. \r\n",

      "I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted, it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband, as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue, but the top stayed put.  overall, very pleased.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this dress because i like the lacing at the neck.. the dress is high quality and comfortable but it runs very large. also... the sleeves on the model are gathered. the sleeves on the dress i received just hang loose and big at the wrist with no gathering whatsoever. they're so wide at the bottom you can't really roll them up without them falling down the next second. it also runs quite long (longer than on the model) and i'm 5'9\". unfortunately, i guess i'll be returning\n",
      "I love this sweater!!! i checked runs large, but it's really just a roomy sweater. i bought the small, which is what i usually buy, but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts, etc. it's soft and cozy and i think i wore it 3 days straight when i first got it - one of those pieces that you will wear over and over. wore it with jeans and a blouse, then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest! love this sweater!!\n",
      "Love this turtleneck! it's perfect for fall and to layer. i'm usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different. i definitely recommend.\n",
      "I love this beautiful summer dress! i am tall (5' 10\"), and this dress is a great length on me. sometimes with high/low dresses, the \"high\" is too short, but this dress is perfect. it does run large. i originally ordered a medium, but had to return it for a small. it is very voluminous. my only complaint would be the arm holes are huge. i am going to have to wear a camisole or bandeau top under it, or you can see my bra.\n",
      "I bought this dress for my mom! she usually does not even try dresses on because she feels that they highlight her \"problem areas\", but she is going on a vacation soon and i thought she could should bring something different for her trip. thankfully, the embroidered waters shirtdress completely surprised her! the fabric is soft and light, the blue is vibrant and perfect for spring/summer, and the cutwork detailing is flirty without being too risky or revealing. she's really excited about this--a\n",
      "I would have kept this dress if it weren't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that, it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice, substantial material.\n",

      "I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium, sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8\", athletic, 150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!\n",
      "I really was surprised at how much i liked this top. it is, as others pointed out, a poncho type overlay with a tank connected underneath. it is very comfortable and forgiving of any body boo boos. looks great with skinny white pants.\n",

      "I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs - curvy through hips, small up top and i got a small and it fit great. i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter. the fabric is super soft and cozy!\n",
      "What a great top!! unusual design\n",
      "Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend\n",
      "I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.\n",
      "Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.\n",
      "Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!\n",
      "Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it's out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well.\n",
      "I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable, absolutely gorgeous on, and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.\n",
      "Very soft, clean feel. i got this in pink and received so many compliments. perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank. i wish they had it in navy as well.\n",
      "I tried this dress on in the store, and nearly bought it. other reviewers commented on the tight chest, but i must admit, this was the one part of the dress that fit like a dream on me. however, i am very small busted (34a). the waist is very flattering, as well. but, the skirt seemed to poof out at the wrong spots (namely, where the pockets are- i love pockets, but not when they create extra bulk at my widest points) and the skirt was about two or three inches longer than i would've liked. anyt\n",

      "This is a very lightweight, comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it \"special\" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium, though the general fit was better. in the end, the looked medium too sloppy for my taste, and the small felt too small.\n",
      "I am tall, so this dress hits slightly above the knee on me. the peek-a-boo detail on the skirt and shoulders is flirty, but still modest. this dress is super comfortable and is going to be a summer staple for me. i also love that this dress is button-down, it is an easy piece to wear for new moms!\n",
      "I went to retailerplpogie today to try this piece on and it was adorable. i really liked the lace part that lightly shows off the legs. this does run true to size. i am 5'5 and 116 pounds and wear a 34b and i was able to button up everything and be comfortable in a size 0. there is no stretch at all with the materials that they have used, so that might be an issue for some. the material was actually a bit thicker than what i would have thought for dress like this, but i really liked it overall and\n",
      "I originally bought this dress in the store. however, it ended being a size too big. so, i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived, i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may\n",
      "I have still not decided if i am keeping this dress. i sized up according to the other reviews. i typically wear a 6, so i got an 8. it fit me just fine on top, but i am a 36b, so fairly small. because of the photos, i expected the dress to be a-line and flare out at the hips. it did not, that that's why i am unsure. i'd like it to flare out a little more than it does. it would be more flattering and more comfortable. i love the dress otherwise. i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there\n",
      "I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.\n",
      "This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?\n",
      "This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.\n",
      "This was was a great buy! i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent. the material is thick and stretchy. there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps. the dress style and cut is very slimming. i am more a size 14 (at 5'10\") and the 12 fit well. i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder. it doesn't lay on me either like it does on the model, but it doesn't detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives.\n",
      "Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.\n",
      "I saw this in that postcard \"catalog\" and it drew my attention immediately, so when i saw it at the store, i knew i would try it on.\r\n",
      "this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7\" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring\n",
      "This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch, the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all, so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality, i would definitely look into other items from this brand, but back this dress went.\n",
      "This hoodie has a lovely, flattering drape and fits true-to-size (m for me), and is light but quite warm. the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style. it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather. i was going to opt for the blue, but in the store, the light gray ~ which is a bit darker and more marled than online (at least on my monitor) ~ looked really lovely and seemed more versatile.\n",
      "Great turtleneck, very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.\n",
      "I loved the lace detailing all over this dress and the fact it had pockets and was mostly cotton. it just looked so inviting, so i grabbed two sizes to try on (10 & 12) that 99% of the time fit me with retailer clothes. here are my thoughts:\n",

      "A feminine yet mature looking cami. i did not need to wear a bra because the material is thick and stretchy (i am a 34a). it looks great with a pencil skirt as well as chino shorts. feels soft and comfy. can dress it up or down. i took a small and it fit perfectly  (l am 5'4\" 120lbs).\n",
      "I love the dress, fits as pictured , i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper, well made.\n",
      "It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.\n",
      "I was eyeing this dress for some time and was undecided about making the purchase. at a reduced price and 40%discount, i had to succumb! i was surprised by the fabric, a bit flimsy. however, the design makes up for the style. i'm anxious to wear at the first opportunity of spring/summer!!!\n",

      "It's super soft. it fits great. happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Cute romper, love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy, and is staticky! for the price it should be better quality. also i'm fairly short and hits high on the leg. not sure how anyone taller could make it work.\n",
      "I have many sweaters but i bought this during the sale and it is very soft and comfortable.\n",

      "I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.\n",

      "I loved the dress way more in person than online. the fabric is very soft and it is quite beautiful. i wear a large in most retailer tops and a size 8/10 in dresses and the large fit perfect.\n",

      "This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.\n",

      "It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots\n",
      "This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a\" hold u in\" feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!\n",
      "Love this dress. it's a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large, it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it.\n",
      "Love the dress. i usually wear a small and will be exchanging it for an x-small.\n",
      "This sweater is wonderful for late summer/early fall or cooler weather over long sleeves. the sleeves taper just below the elbow, which seems slightly odd when first putting it on - as though they should be a tad longer (hence the 4 stars), but i quickly forget about this while wearing the sweater and it does look great!\n",
      "These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. \"one size\" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.\n",
      "Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!\n",
      "This is such a great top! it runs huge though. i normally wear a small but bought the xs. it fits ok. i would prefer the xxs, but i bought it on sale and retailer is sold out. for reference, i am 5`6 and about 138 lbs. very flowy soft fabric, great purchase.\n",
      "I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didn't look like much on the hanger. i'm 5'3\" and curvy and the s fit great. it will look great with boots or booties. it's very comfortable and nice quality material.\n",
      "I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the\n",
      "Soft, comfy, great fit. this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter. looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly. the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terry/jersey material. i'm usually a medium and the medium fit great. slimming lines and does a great job of being swingy/flared, without that tent look.\n",
      "I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.\n",
      "This dress is stunning in person, though the pictures do it no justice. it was overall a very clingy fit. i'm 5'3 with long legs and it was too short for me so i did not purchase, but would recommend it for those with short legs.\n",

      "Good quality, cute and great color as pictured. perfect for leggings or tight ankle pants.\n",
      "Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8\" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6.\n",
      "I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky, but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt. i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful. a basic piece with a little bit more; very happy\n",
      "Although i bought 2 sizes down from my regular size, they were still big and, made my derriere look flat. i would have kept them as weekend kick-around jeans, but the flat behind just made them a must return.\n",
      "I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!\n",
      "Got this in the gold and it's so much better than i imagined. runs longer on my 5'4 frame than on model but i love this extra long look with white fitted pants and heels. total classic easy elegance and comfortable too.\n",
      "I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!\n",

      "I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,\n",
      "Great shirt that runs true to size. i got the turqouise color which is very pretty. it cuts lower, but doesn't show much cleavage.\n",
      "This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference, i am 5'3\" and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair, it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall.\n",
      "I love the way this looks on me! definitely flattering on curvy/full-figured girls. i am a 36-38c and bought an xl - i don't like things that are too tight or that cling to the wrong areas. if they had xl in other sizes, i would buy it in every color. can be dressed up or down. i'm very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Beautiful top. works wonderful on hourglass figures.\n",
      "Great top for day to night. fine for work (i'd think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned, but b cup and below doesn't gape so very work appropriate.)\n",
      "Upon opening this top, i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall, but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin, and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots, but i love this shirt. i got the xs, which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s, but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.\n",
      "This is a simple, light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall, i'm happy to see a basic executed well.\n",
      "These jeans are exactly what i was looking for. love the rich olive color. these are definitely an olive green and not a brown color, which i was very happy about. fit is great, i am 5'7\" 150 athletic hippy build and a size 29 fits great. they are the perfect ankle length jean. very soft, and just the right amount of stretch.\n",
      "I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning, but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium, so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.\n",
      "I'm always weary of v necks but this shirt is great. the fit is true to size and while it is a v neck, it's not such a deep plunge that you need a cami underneath. great material too and perfect for dressing up a bit. i bought the blue color and love it!\n",
      "Overall: soft material, cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a, than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad\n",
      "The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean, otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.\n",
      "Deletta has done it again, designed a top that is unique, flattering, and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of\n",
      "This is my third top from this designer, and normally i wear a small, but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me. i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost, but the sapphire is wonderful. works great with slacks or more casual clothes. i liked the sleeve length as well. i'm not too busty, but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem.\n",
      "If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person, i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3\" and 115lbs, this dress is not too short. however, the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so.\n",
      "This dress is beautiful. it is even prettier in person than in pictures... i was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail! i am 5'2, 125 lbs and went with a 4p, and it fit perfectly. (i typically do not like things to be extremely clingy). this could easily be dressed up or down. personally, i wore it to a wedding, and received many compliments on its uniqueness.\n",
      "I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy, sleeves way too long, etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line, you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.\n"

      "the print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.\n",

      "i ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.\n",

      "got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm '\", #, b\n",

      "i absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt \"wing out\" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.\n",
      "i am a true size xl. in my s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size  i am a d cup\n",
      "i bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least - sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.\n",

      "i picked this dress up in a size  - fits tts. i have a dd chest;  lbs. and  ft.  inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size  was too big and the  fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not, it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about  inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday\n",
      "love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.\n",

      "this dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.\n",

      "i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty.\n",
      "on me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look  pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...\r\n",

      "to be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave.\n",
      "i loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s//) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.\n",

      "sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.\n",
      "the fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.\n",

      "there's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye, but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.\n",
      "always love getting pilcro pants and these are just as good as previously purchased ones. i got the grey in  and i'm glad i did - i've ranged from a size - so i wasn't super sure which size would be be best.\n",
      "the cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however, the armhole is way too low, which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low, most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!\n",

      "bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.\n",
      "it's true to size but as an fyi for fellow pilcro high rise wearers, don't size down like you might with them. i had my regular and my high rise pilcro sizes and my regular size fit in these. the down side for these is they are clingy and a bit prone to a camel toe effect until they stretch out during the day\n",
      "i ordered two colors of these in p.  i am keeping them because they feel wonderful on, but they definitely have to be hemmed! i measured the inseam on both pairs to be closer to  inches.   inches is not a petite length.\n",
      "corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!\n",

      "the turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.\n",

      "the wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm '\" lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.\n",
      "looks just like it does on the model. i am 'lbs and the ps fits perfectly. i wore mine with a t and wedges. adorable and more importantly, comfortable! flows nicely without being distracting. got lots of compliments.\n",

      "great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top, easily dress up and down!\n",
      "knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm '\" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t\n",

      "the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.\n",
      "i love this tee, and am a picky tee person. it runs big, the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am  lbs and '\". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not  stars due to stretched out arm holes.\n",
      "love the material, pockets, length (i wear petitie - i'm ') etc. i usually wear a medium, but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!\n",
      "awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.\n",
      "i love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.\n",
      "i took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm '' and  lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good.\n",
      "this dress is stunning. i loved the cut and seam detailing. it is very flattering...if it fits. i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size /. i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs, back and tummy. i bought the large and it doesn't' come in a bigger size :( it is very well made and completely lines. i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you.\n",
      "lovely color and sweet top, but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.\n",
      "i wish there were  colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something.\n",
      "i bought  shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.\n",
      "love this shirt, it's so comfy for fall/ winter, but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!\n",
      "i saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!\n",
      "\n",
      "first of all, the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an\n",
      "actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.\n",
      "i tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.\n",
      "this gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light, airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.\n",
      "this is a great fall shirt. great for dressing up casual wear!!!\n",
      "the size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic, thin tank, but it's a good every day, wear all the time staple.\n",
      "i bough the blue color and love it. the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top. it drapes nicely, and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work (i'm at a tech company, so casual to business casual). the ombre color is gorgeous! (the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely).\r\n",
      "regarding what other reviewers said: yes, it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped, b\n",
      "i ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm '\"/ c / lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large, it did wash up well though, no pilling.\n",
      "love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that.\n",
      "just purchased this skirt. it is absolutely the most comfortable skirt for every season......every color imaginable will go with this skirt. great with denim shirt too. lightweight cotton knit makes the skirt comfy with any temperature. waistband is wide and slimming to the tummy. i stand  foot  inches,  lbs and it is perfect in length. platform or flats, dress up or down. my favorite is a v neck tee with a couple necklaces and your good to go......\n",
      "there's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...\n",
      "i purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am ft inches and lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!\n",
      "fits large, wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.\n",
      "it definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a cute top but i wore it for around  hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.\n",
      "i like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller, it would work for you.\n",
      "this is a very flattering pencil skirt. i found it in the store and bought an xs, and have been wearing it to work. it is not too short, and the wrap fit looks great.\n",
      "its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet, it's almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!\n",
      "super soft and comfy, with stylish look\n",
      "i have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.\n",
      "i too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.\n",
      "thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front, so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!\n",
      "i was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am '' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it\n",
      "runs a bit tight around upper arms. love the collar.\n",
      "this vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about - pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm '\", , and usually wear a  or .\n",
      "i stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy, chic, and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner, i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges, silver cuff, silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way, which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear, but double-sided tape easily kept my bra\n",
      "this is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm '\", #, /, and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out\n",
      "i saw the xxs petite in green in my store, adn decided to try this on only becasue it was a petite and in the store. i don't see green as an option nline anymore, so it must have been a old return... it is extremely soft, as others mentioned, and the fit is really flaterring. i bought it then read abou the rebviews, so will see... the fact that i bought the xxs, means it must run big!\n",
      "this was returned in store in an xs. i tried it on and it fit. shorter so it was probably meant to be a mini. i will hold on to it for now. on sale so worth the price. colors are nice and bright\n",
      "i absolutely loved this the minute i saw it. the quality is impeccable, and the fit is amazing. i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick (back to the quality of this piece, amazing!!) and some women may not like the extra \"bulk\" to that part of the body. however i'm still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it. thank you retailer for always providing unique, quality pieces :)\n",
      "this dress may not be worth the full price of $ but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress \"sack\" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.\n",
      "the print of this dress is what enticed me, and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however, the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined, but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days, but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well. \r\n",
      "the dress is more a-line than pictured, which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare\n",
      "i was not expecting to like this. i tried it on in the store on a whim. it happened to drape beautifully. this will be a great work dress for the summer with something underneath the bring up the neckline. the blue color is soft and pretty.\n",
      "i have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer  years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size, i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store, but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm, perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft, so soft, not bulky at all. if this is your s\n",
      "i saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra %, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.\n",
      "unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.\n",
      "this top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.\n",
      "love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, \"that's going to pill up.\" and i ignored her. and she was right.\n",
      "this is stunning. it's almost snug for a  (i'm ',  lb) but that might be because it's strapless. it's constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one. i can't wait to wear this and i'm going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress. i feel like audrey hepburn in this.\n",
      "the pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a c/d and normally wear an  or  and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)\n",
      "the material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!\n",
      "this robe is exactly what i was looking for.  it's perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off.  it is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but that's fine for me.  only downside is that it has to be hand washed.\n",
      "i bought the deep maroon which is beautiful. absolutely love the softness, length and the casual look. you can dress it up and dress it down. it does run big. i got the medium but could wear the small easily enough. since i am  feet tall, i wanted to length to be where it is. the only part i did not like is the / length sleeves as it is tough when wearing a jacket over it.\n",
      "the fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me\n",
      "love this sweater! i have it in the raspberry and the charcoal color. it's so soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans or leggings. it's casual but you can dress it up a bit and you still looked polished. it's a little oversized. only downfall is that it piles easily.\n",
      "i think this shirt is so cute. it is well-made. it's a flattering fit, and it's unusual. it still is a neutral though so you can wear it with lots of things. i'm really happy i bought it.\n",
      "looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am '\" and weigh  pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it.\n",
      "this is long--as it is shown in the picture. i am five , and it's actually too long for me. it looks a bit matronly on as it's just so long. i loved the fabric--it's not heavy and it's super soft. i think it runs one size big. it's made very well, and as i stated, it is a nice fabric with a soft hand. it would be nice for a crisp fall day. that being said, the length just isn't right and does nothing for me. i'm five  and slender . i definitely do not think a petite woman would like this or be\n",
      "soft, cozy, and cute, but pilled badly after st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only.\n",
      "for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money.\n",
      "i purchased the xs petite ( i'm '\".  lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs, but i was ok with it being looser.\n",
      "wanted to love this dress, bit it wasn't to be. strange fit, and doesn't drape nicely, as in the photo. also, the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "i ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too.\n",
      "like the other reviewers said, it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!\n",
      "i really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for\n",
      "the shirt is great, aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though, and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to.\n",
      "so the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look, short, sexy length (i'm '\" and the petite barely covers my assets), and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed, but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all, which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back\n",
      "this dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am  feet tall / lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however, so i would caution that it may not be work \"office\" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses, it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or\n",
      "i bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy.\n",

      "i really, really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty, and the front was flattering, but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly, i sent it back.\n",
      "i love wearing this sweater, it is unbelievably soft and cozy. usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me, so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame. i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am '\"  lbs and it was long, but not at all overwhelming. it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day. i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels. would look great with leggings and bo\n",

      "i was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.\n",
      "beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light, yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large, but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is, it works.\n",
      "wonderful, slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit.\n",
      "i have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger. i like the coral color the best for its versatility. the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic. i especially like the back, the stitching is already very flattering, but then the pleats really add an extra touch. the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longer-especially with it being a cashmere piece. i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way, which would make it much too short an\n",
      "i love this top-it fits true to size, hits at the low hip so its not too short, and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans, freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots, and a glittery silver necklace, but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt, tights and boots, and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm\n",
      "this jacket is cute and comfy!\n",
      "i had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer. \r\n",

      "i'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm '\", c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!\n",

      "this coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.\n",

      "the fabric is very nice and it is completely lined, except for the sleeves, which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter, so wearing this on a hot day won't work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it's roomy, straight, and quite flowy.  i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it's just like the picture. it hits below the knee.\n",

      "i bought this item in store, in the loden green color. i absolutely love it as a light winter dress or tunic. the material is thin, but provides a nice coverage nonetheless. it is super duper comfy, and very figure flattering! i wear it mainly as a dress, and looks great with tights and ankle boots. so pleased ordering the other color.\n",
      "i like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue, but the top is black, kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise, but they're actually more green. at any rate, it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it.\n",

      "i got this top in the black floral print. the print is very pretty and so is the neckline, but the body is very loose and shapeless. it's not flattering. i think the shirt is a little too short as well. it would be nicer if it was longer. nevertheless, it is a pretty top.\n",

      "it just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy, even though it's brand new. it fits fine, but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny, like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front, which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible,\n",

      "this is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.\n",
      "the reviews i read scared me a little about this top being super cropped. it is on the short side, but will be adorable with shorts and pants that aren't low cut. the multi-textured fabric is gorgeous!\n",
      "i purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite  and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a \" waist, \" hips and i'm '\" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not\n",
      "i bought this for an event, and when it arrived, i realized it was probably too dressy for my event. there are some large sparkly clusters of \"stones\" that are beautiful, but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed. if i had something to wear it to, i would keep it in a heartbeat. the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces. there are cups already in the bodice, which is a huge plus imo. it's unique and beautiful!\n",
      "i was so pumped to see a slightly different version of last years, military swing shirtdress, because i loved the idea of it, but it was just was too voluminous and short for me... well, this year, i ordered a size up, remembering that last years dress ran right in the chest and shoulders. i guessed right! this time, in a size up, i had breathing room and was much more comfortable. this dress is also a lot less billowy. there is sting definitely a swing but a much less dramatic version! my issue\n",
      "it's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however, the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store, unfortunately.\n",

      "xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders, cehst), but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular, a bit longer, but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this, but probably something beter wil lcome along.\r\n",

      "this is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer.

      "i love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price.\n",

      "i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am '\" a  dd size .\n",
      "the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.\n",

      "often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.\r\n",
      "the quality is shocking! looks like a $ dress.\r\n",
      "true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big.\n",
      "from the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size  and i am ' and  lbs.\n",
      "my title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!\n",
      "unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!\n",
      "this dress will take you through fall, winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "i loved the dog on this sweater, and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on, like others, i did find it to be itchy, but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are, so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...\n",
      "i love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.\n",
      "given that i am petite with thighs (take a size p or p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good\n",
      "i love this dress! it has pockets in front. timeless. fun. dress up or down.\n",
      "there were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a\n",
      "material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!\n",
      "i'm '\", lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size  and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!\n",
      "i really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique, a \"mossy\" fuzzy print, and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am ftin, b,  waist,  hips), the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but, if you do not wear a turtleneck under it, you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!\n",
      "i was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back.\n",
      "awesome flares and very flattering! a wardrobe staple!\n",
      "i ordered a six  petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm '  lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get, because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.\n",
      "okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it  stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth  because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though, wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav\n",
      "i just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d\n",
      "this is a really cute style of t-sihrt. i totally disagree with the reviewers who thought this was too short in the torso and/or overwhelming. i'm '\" and about  pounds and this fits just fine. (i ordered a size small.) beautiful drape and (i thought) relatively slim cut. the only reason i'm not giving this  stars across the board is that the fabric is a little too thin (not sheer or see-through, but not as substantial as i would expect for the price.\n",
      "this is my new favorite top! it's so comfortable and looks great. i wish i could order it in more colors!\n",
      "i love this top! its so comfortable and light weight! it drapes beautifully, with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom. so flattering! i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out!\n",

      "i really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm  ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size\n",
      "i loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l, and there is no stretch through the bust, so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest, this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap, skinny jeans and boots.\n",
      "now this is a summer staple! love the design of the bib of this tee. super soft, great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down. it is loose, i'd recommend sizing down.\n",
      "got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.\n",
      "button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am '\" and small-framed, and the size  fits just right.\n",
      "this top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online, but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape, overall it was a great buy.\n",
      "i ordered the \"london, paris, milan\" print red top in a size . i go back and forth with ordering 's and 's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall.\n",
      "the perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit,looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top, the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death.\n",
      "unfortunately, i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse. armholes are cut in a bit too far for my  year old arms. was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling, but the neckline wasn't layering as i had hoped. i am only '\" but want a bit more length.\r\n",
      "i think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown, on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer. seems to be well made, sadly i must return.\n",
      "\n",
      "the photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y, but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm ' but thin on top- usually between xs & s, and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try), sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!\n",
      "first, it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.\n",
      "this top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra, the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole, it was that big. this went back, will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp, this was an xsp.\n",
      "this is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!\n",

      "this blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.\n",
      "true to size, and adorable. very lightweight, will be great for the long, hot summer ahead!\n",
      "i wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.\n",
      "i had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/-  lbs, aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad\n",

      "so unflattering! really disappointed. made me look  month pregnant and i'm a petite size .\n",

      "this blouse is a great transitional piece. as other reviewers have noted, the sleeves are split and that's the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five. i wore it with a / sleeve black top underneath to eliminate this issue for the cooler months. overall design is good and the print is classy and creative. this will be a lovelyt go-to blouse to wear with denim. fits the budget too.\n",
      "this top is prettier in person than on the picture. the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap - it actually looks nice in person. it's very comfy and feminine, showing just the right amount of skin on the arms. the elastic on the waist also makes me look  lbs. lighter. it goes good with jeans or skirts.\n",
      "this blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti\n",

      "this is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.\n",

      "this dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here's what i don't like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow can't get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress.\n",
      "i tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body.\n",

      "love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or  in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.\n",

      "this is a cute sweater, i agree that it's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute. the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen, more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone. i think it's true to size, i got my usual retailer size: xspetite (i'm aa, \" waist) and it fits just right. it's soft and a nice medium weight. on the packaging it was called a bomber, so i'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket.\n",
      "i'm a ddd and although that's pretty large, i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing.

      "caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm '\" and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!\n",

      "the sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece.\n",
      "this top fits exactly as it does on the model! it's flattering and comfortable. i wore it to work with dress slacks and got a lot of complements. it's easy to pair with pants or jeans. my only complaint is the material it's made of is a bit rougher and thicker than i thought it would be. but that's minor. i am a petite but this fit me well even though i got it in a regular size.\n",
      "i decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also ) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.\n",
      "i had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on -line. they are very flattering and well-made. runs a little small, i am ' and  lbs; small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work. thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection!\n",
      "i wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.\n",
      "i love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.\n",

      "i got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my '\" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season.\n",
      "this sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.\n",

      "purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate\n",

      "i adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff, but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length, as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!\n",

      "i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $ i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but\n",

      "these shorts were just what i expected from retailer. they are more pretty in person, particularly for the color - like a rich clay color, not garish orange. very good quality fabric & the embroidery around the edges is unique. i'm usually a size small in bottoms from retailer & the s fits perfectly.\n",

      "it's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $ for a t-shirt.\r\n",

      "this tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.\n",
      "this tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!\n",

      "i love everything about this skirt, except that it adds bulk to the waist and/or hip area because of lots of fabric and pleating.   i still love it and when i place the waist band higher on my waist looks super cute with a dainty blouse tucked in.   i'm '  and have a tiny belly  pooch that comes and goes through out the day so although this skirt is beautiful it tends to magnify the tiniest of belly pooches and hips.  i think i love the skirt too much to retun.\n",

      "the shirt is darling, soft and relaxed fit. i usually wear an xs or small in most retailer tops. unfortunately, i ordered an xs and should have ordered the small. i found the length to be a little short in the xs so i'm sending it back to exchange for the small. i hope it's just a little bit longer.\n",
      "these pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy. the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants. there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well, which i like.\n",
      "i ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.\n",
      "nice print and comfortable shirt.\n",
      "i just received this jumpsuit and was so excited.  unfortunately it is too small and will have to go back.  the top is so cute and the material is thick so no need for a bra which i really liked.  it runs short in the stride and also in the top.  i ordered a petite since i am only '\" tall and was very surprised how short the stride was.  the length was great and would love to have been able to kept it.\n",
      "tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a % email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!\n",
      "seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.\n",

      "this shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!\n",
      "pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm '). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.\n",
      "i love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!\n",

      "this is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees, size down. xs works good for me.\n",
      "i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.\n",
      "these shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size  or . i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.\n",

      "i walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually, i have to buy petite-sized pants, but the length fit at my ankle, and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer, i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops, but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater.\n",

      "i love boys and arrows, but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because there's no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support. also, the fabric is super soft, which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost! for my d's i chose a different design.\n",
      "this jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don't wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.\n",
      "i love the pilcro line and these leggings (yes definitely more a legging than jean) did not disappoint. however, i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight.  they are pricey, so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well.\n",
      "i have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a\n",
      "i bought this in white and coral. i usually wear xl, but both l and xl fit well. i bought coral in l and white in xl. it is a tad see-through but not a lot. the top is comfortable and looks very good on, coral is so dreamy and white perfect for a casual day out. i am not crazy about linen fabric though, it can be a bit scratchy, i would have preferred if the top were in a softer fabric. for now though i plan to keep both.\n",

      "cute shirt, nice for layering.\n",
      "this dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me.\n",
      "i saw this online and loved it. i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion, but this tee-shirt sold out in the color holly. completely sold out but for petite. i bought a s and a m. the small works. it is comfortable. it can be dressy or very casual. i bought the white and the carbon. it is a different style on a tee. if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean. i recommend this highly. i can't imagine anyone not liking it.\n",

      "i was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable t-shirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on. i love it, it's a different take on a t-shirt. it's comfortable and stylish. i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one. i'm even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors.\n",

      "this will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal\n",
      "these jeans didn't fit like i thought , based on the model. i usually wear  , but these were snug and i i have snug jeans , lots of them and i wanted looser , flared jeans ,kind of a 's look. not these. a bigger size wouldn't have improved it . they are a perfectly good jean , love the color but not what i wanted .\n",
      "i was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own, but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests, etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it  stars for quality, but it is holding up well so far.\n",
      "i have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite  stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.\n",

      "got this in white and love the scallop detail. the material is also super soft and stretchy. i would've absolutely loved this in black, but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much. i think this would be super cute on a taller frame. got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit!\n",
      "i got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!\n",
      "this jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size  or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it, too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped, probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it, otherwise might appear too short.\n",
      "nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it's the body i'm putting it on that's less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just doesn't do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile.\n",

      "i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).\n",

      "i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.\n",
      "these are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.\n",
      "long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).\r\n",

      "i am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.\n",

      "what a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size  (-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.\n",

      "this dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.\n",

      "i bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size, it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.\n",

      "liked everything about these but they should say in the description that they're ribbed.\n",
      "i couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all  colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all  are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!\n",

      "this is a cute jacket, nice materials, comfortable, and feels very well made. i read some reviews about sizing and went with a small when i am usually an xs or s. the small was too big and boxy feeling, i think i would have liked it better if it felt like a more tailored fit. the design is definitely different and i played around with the collar drape thing but it felt a little awkward to me. overall, i think it's a cute jacket, but i sent it back, not for me.\n",
      "i couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!\n",

      "this is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a c and while i'd normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer.\n",
      "i loved this dress. i'm '\" and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long. i have a larger chest (double d) and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly.  i got compliments from everyone, gorgeous dress.\n",
      "simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a  and  and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.\n",
      "this dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!\n",
      "i tried this on, left, went back, put it on hold, then finally took the plunge. i had a hard time justifying the price. not really a functional coat, too warm to be a shirt. but so unique, i had to have it!! i got the s/m. boxy, in a good way. got it yesterday with the antro members % off.\n",
      "i love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh\n",
      "i was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.\n",

      "i like the idea of a skort, and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!\n",

      "i wanted to love this dress, and i don't. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again, very often.\n",
      "i wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!\n",

      "i loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.\n",

      "very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.\n",

      "i bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.\n",
      "really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up.\n",
      "i have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size /small and this was a little short and snug.\n",
      "this is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!\n",
      "bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.\n",
      "i love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version, but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.\n",
      "very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.\n",
      "love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!\n",
      "i adore this shirt. like a previous reviewer, the shirt runs a little small in the bust. i got a  instead of my typical  and it looks great. the quality is great and the color is lovely. the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight.\n",
      "so thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.\n",
      "hi, i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.\n",
      "i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with  kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...\n",
      "i loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.\n",
      "i love the look of this sweater, but just bought and put on at home and noticed  pea sized holes in fabric, near arm holes, but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy, they kind of look like moth holes...\n",
      "the design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality, then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit, i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!\n",
      "\n",
      "this is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows.\n",
      "these leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.\n",
      "this button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.\n",
      "this sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.\n",
      "this has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.\n",
      "fantastic top! fits, flatters and falls beautifully! i loved the white so much i went back for the black! i wear with jeans, leggings and with pant suits. lovely with all!\n",
      "what a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.\n",
      "this coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the \"madeline\" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression...\n",
      "ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm '\" and weigh around . the sleeves are slightly longer than /. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $.\n",
      "i bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.\n",
      "i wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.\n",
      "i bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high\n",
      "love this top. i have it in several colors and i'm waiting for the black to be restocked. it's somewhat sheer. perfect w my kimonos\n",
      "i bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!\n",
      "i have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between  and  degrees. this \"coat\" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)\n",
      "visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s\n",
      "i adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a c and size  and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well, as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one, since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer, but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top, etc.)\n",
      "this dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.\n",
      "i bought this t-shirt in three colors and i'm keeping them because they work for what i want (travel clothes) but the t-shirts run big and are too boxy. i think they look nice if you tuck them in.\n",
      "i have not a actually purchased this coat yet but was able to try it on at my local retailer. thought i'd pass along a couple of details the description is missing. the coat is not lined. i have regular length arms and the sleeves are a bit short, not quite / length but not long enough to keep my wrists warm. also, i was afraid the red would be more orange, it is a very pretty red. it also runs a little big. i am '\" medium, athletic build and would probably consider a m but it seemed bi\n",
      "i loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!\n",
      "i love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c\n",
      "i echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering.\n",
      "love this cost! runs large. usually wear a medium or large, ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small. fits perfect now. not very heavy so don't buy if you're looking for a warm coat.\n",
      "i love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it.\n",
      "the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else ('\",  #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me.\n",

      "i love everything about this skirt! the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully. fits great. a bit long for me as i'm ' but totally worth it. i don't wear heels so i might need to alter the length, but i knew it would be long when i ordered it. i purchased the grey, but i might have to order the taupe as well!\n",
      "i had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous, like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential, but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.\n",
      "i bought an extra small and i love it (i'm a size -). it's warm, it's comfortable, it fits with everything, can be dressed up or down, it's not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coat...it feels like you have a new friend...\n",
      "loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i\n",

      "i ordered these in m ('\"  lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature\n",
      "a few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this, i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey, not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said, it's very pretty, i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder, and i'll give the xs a shot instead!\n",
      "do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone\n",
      "the jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am ' and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.\n",
      "this top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high, which was a surprise for a summer tank, but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top.\n",
      "this is a great little top. colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life. ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model. you could probably size down. armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it. the body flows but it's not huge and is slimming. the high neck and tie are darling. will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools. good buy on sale.\n",
      "super soft fabric, however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl, normally wear /.  i had to return it.\n",
      "runs small in the chest, so don't order if you are large chested! over all, very cute.\n",
      "i love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "the photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.\n",
      "i love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly, too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am '\" and a size , and the  fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build, rather than curvy.\n",

      "great fit and extremely comfortable.\n",
      "this dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.\n",

      "i got the cream color and absolutely love the style and color of this sweater. however, when i tried it on at the store, the one i tried on was super soft and comfy. i ended up finding this later on sale and ordered it online. when i got it, i don't know if it was once worn or washed by someone before, but the inside was not soft at all! i was so sad! anyone else have this experience? size is great. i ordered an xs.\n",
      "i saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff, plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots, but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan, so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s\n",

      "i tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.\n",
      "i have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a p and p. the p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these\n",
      "i ordered this for the colors, and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans, and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach, then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach, and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots, then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out, completely. i air dried, and\n",

      "the design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite % spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size  for  lb/.'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.\n",

      "very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!\n",
      "colors are vibrant (i ordered the blue color combo) material is light and feels great against your skin.\n",

      "this dress is absolutely gorgeous! the colors are actually very bright. it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area. the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip. i found that it runs true to size. i got a medium, as i wanted it to be more roomy. i'm planning to wear it with booties, long boots, or sandals in the spring. i think it will make a great teacher dress.\n",

      "i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.\n",
      "i purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it, but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang\n",
      "i cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.\n",
      "i had my eye on this tee for awhile, and finally ordered the turquoise/navy in the small. as soon as i received it, i ordered it in the taupe/peach and am contemplating one more! i plan to layer it now and can't wait to wear it solo next spring and summer. the colors are gorgeous (although the taupe is more dark gray which i love), the material is very soft, stretchy and comfortable, but it's the very flattering cut that sold me. it hangs beautifully and doesn't cling to my middle but skims it p\n",

      "this dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm '\" # // and purchased size m.\n",
      "this is a busy dress that makes me think \"boho-glam holly hobby\". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style.\n",
      "the pattern and fabric are lovely, but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.\n",
      "i just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative, and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes, yet i do not like to look \"frumpy.\" this is cute and chic, yet conservative. also j got % because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!\n",
      "great dress - fits tts (i am a p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.\n",

      "i always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.\n",

      "i ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly. i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings. the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels.\n",
      "this top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas, it's going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "i wanted to love this so much! i am ' and normally do a size large in retailer, but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine, but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing, but overall, just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material, not denim.\n",
      "i bought these leggings for yoga. i love them. the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus. the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings. the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice! for reference, i am ',  lbs and i purchased a m. fit was great. i normally wear size - in pants. would recommend.\n",
      "this seems like a great top! i have only worn it once, but it is super soft and comfy, yet stylish. sleeves are fun. color is vibrant as shown.\n",
      "i purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute. it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties. i cannot wait to wear it....any day now!  great choice.\n",

      "this is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it's the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!\n",

      "i ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...\n",
      "tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering. the liner was fine, but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent. tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick.\n",

      "the bad:\n",
      "when i tried it on, i found the bust to be too small, and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also, the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.\n",

      "the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl\n",
      "very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one.\n",
      "i ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed, but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes, it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress, with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others, the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model, it isn't real\n",
      "after readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.\n",
      "too much material everywhere. i am lbs '\" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.\n",
      "okay i'm short, so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty, but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!\n",
      "this dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(\n",
      "i was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did, thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress.\n",
      "i almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.\n",
      "this was pretty to look at: nice weight, lining, colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great, so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me, though...\n",
      "i am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all\n",

      "i ordered this dress in both colors. i'm very fair and blonde and the darker dress just swallowed me up - looked really messy on me. the lighter one.....love it. it's very flowy and not form fitting, of course, but something about the lighter color just seems less overwhelming.\n",
      "i like this dress a lot. it does not have much form but with a belt looks great!\n",
      "i bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm '\" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty\n",

      "this is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm ', llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.\n",
      "i ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it's so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it's nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces, vests, pins, belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable, pret\n",

      "by itself, this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however, with a belt, it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt, the skirt falls perfectly , it's perfect, especially with it's rich colors.\n",

      "i walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.\n",
      "i saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, \"well that's a no-brainer!\" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm ',  lbs and the m\n",

      "i own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.\n",
      "i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am '' and . i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well.\n",

      "i didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!\n",

      "i purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.\n",

      "the cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics, but in person i found it femine, pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky, colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy, gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.\n",

      "the fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look \"hippy\". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.\n",
      "the fabric making this dress is great quality- heavyweight and so soft against the skin. the design is near perfect with an extraordinarily flattering silhouette that hangs just right from the hips with poof or flare. the fateful flaw is in the neckline; a broad boat shape that looks awkward couples with a corset-like torso that acts as a push up bra. not for larger busted woman (d here) and certainly not suitable for work.\n",

      "i'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little \"holes\" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.\n",
      "i was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.\n",

      "this top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.\n",
      "before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.\n",
      "a great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a  b or  a and am lbs. the small was the best fit as the  (xs) was a very small . i could almost say it more of a  if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!\n",
      "absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.\n",
      "what drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many \"clothes\" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes\n",
      "i must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually \"natural\" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true\n",
      "this shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm '\" and  pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.\n",
      "this top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.\n",
      "after reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas\n",
      "overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn't love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down.\n",
      "the online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think \"oh my gosh, that's the one!\" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.\n",
      "lots of seam and stitching details make this even cuter than the picture's initial impression. fabric drapes nicely. the sleeves are a little tight if wearing something long-sleeved underneath. overall very unique!\n",
      "love the pattern. the pants are really cute! perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in. they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable\n",
      "i'm '\" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami.\n",
      "this dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.\n",
      "i feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.\n",
      "love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!\n",
      "i tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a \"slight\" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu\n",

      "love this dress, very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.\n",
      "love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.\n",
      "as per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.\n",
      "i love this jacket so much, i bought two. it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather. i recommend you grab it while it's on sale.\n",
      "this tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.\n",
      "i really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.\n",
      "i like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)\n",
      "i tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on % of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little \"low\" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.\n",
      "i wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am ' and lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.\n",
      "i recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was  percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable, elegant and very chic. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i will make this my go-to dress from now on.\n",
      "i ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm '\" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller.\n",
      "i am ' \" about  lbs. thought this fit really well. very comfortable material. i wish the skirt was a different color-feels a little bland.\n",
      "the fabric is very thick and textured almost like upholstery and has no give to it.  the zipper is a little tricky to get all the way up because of the fabric thickness. i looks cute and holds its shape. it may run a touch small because of the fabric. the colors are great though and i really like it.\n",
      "this is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.\n",
      "i have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.\n",
      "these pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!\n",
      "this is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.\n",
      "this is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.\n",
      "i purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo\n",
      "i tried these on at the store and the fit was good, the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton, which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs, so it wasn't ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half.\n",
      "the pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.\n",
      "these pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.\n",
      "i wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design - the wrap on the top. i got it in grey and it's a beautiful color for winter. the dress is very comfortable to wear.\n",
      "i bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.\n",
      "this dress has a great design and fits very well and looks great. although the material is not cheap it is very warm and doesn't breath very well which is good in the winter. the only complaint i have is there was a small snag in it, but i was able to fix it my self.\n",
      "i worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.\n",
      "no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.\n",
      "it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom\n",

      "my size was not available so based on reviews stating the bagginess of a certain area, i sized down and glad i did. i never size down because i do not like tight clothing, especially casual wear. nice muted print and good quality terry material. recommend, but size down if you want a more fitted feel.\n",

      "great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but\n",
